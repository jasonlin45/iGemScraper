Leon Bongers: The MEB and most regulatory authorities in Europe only work by paper. After their reply, we do a reassessment and a final decision is taken. Katrin: You told us that the EMA and, for example, the MEB have different medicines that they evaluate, so they don't interfere. But it might happen for example when a member state in Europe considers that a product does more harm than that it is efficacious. Taina Mattila: In principle, there is no specific risk in short-term use. But for example, the long-term risks with children are not completely known, for example for maturation. Basically, the benefits of melatonin have really conclusively in my personal opinion been only shown in jet lag and to some extent to the indication of Circadin at the moment. Katrin: I read that a side effect of taking melatonin is blood in the urine. When the company wanted it to be allowed, they only asked to allow it for the age of 55 years onwards.

One major topic was the insect toxin we had originally chosen as kill mechanisms of the S.H.I.E.L.D. When asked by Dr. Himmel about its properties, it became obvious that the data available was not sufficient to ensure the safe usage in our trap. We discussed how to deal with information on toxin-producing and -secreting bacteria with both Dr. Mirko Himmel and Piers Millett, iGEM Director of Safety and Security. In the environment, E. coli would no longer be provided with it, causing the production of the transcription factor to cease. Since genetically altered E. coli are only able to survive in the environment as a symbiosis with cyanobacteria and the survival of those in African climatic conditions is highly unlikely, Dr. Himmel agreed this would be a feasible approach to ensure our traps biosafety. We strongly suggest to implement this feature to anyone deciding to further develop our project before applying it for registration. When told about the S.H.I.E.L.D.’s approach, Dr. Jacobs assessed transfer of pathogens between landing mosquitoes to be very unlikely because even under laboratory circumstances the infection of mosquitoes is quite hard to achieve, and pathogens would not be able to survive for on the hydrogel for longer times. We interviewed multiple experts from Uganda and Tanzania, countries in which malaria still threatens many people despite significant efforts towards malaria elimination. He is postdoctoral researcher at the Imperial College in London. Dr. Andrew Hammond helped pushing our project further by sharing his expertise on project development and legislature with us. Specifically close to possible breeding sites, such as stagnant freshwater, close to bushes and on the outside of houses by eaves are optimal locations to ensure mosquitoes are eliminated before they get in contact with residents."  },  {    "id": "",    "School": "Hamburg",    "Section": "Overgraduate",    "Year": 2018,    "Wiki hyperlink": "http://2018.igem.org/Team:Hamburg",    "Award": "",    "Outreach Category": "Integrated Human Practices",    "Outreach Project": "Interview with Dr. Andrew Hammond",    "Project Tag": "Consult Experts",    "": "",    "Product Description": "",    "Product Tag": "",    "Audience": "Gain Information for iGEM Project",    "Goal": "Scientific Community",    "__1": "",    "Data Type": "",    "Data": "",    "Reach": "",    "Analysis": "",    "References": "",    "Description": "Since we know how important it is to spark interests at an early age, we wanted to promote knowledge about life sciences and synthetic biology, as well as share our passion for science in general.

This means that a treatment for Nosema is desperately needed if beekeeping is to continue to flourish. Application: This reassured us that our project was going to have an impact on our community because it is needed. We wanted to ensure that beekeepers really wanted a new product, so that we could be assured our product would be useful. But beekeepers also established that fumagillin was far from perfect, and so an alternative was needed regardless of its existence. This was because such research would affect a beekeeper’s organic certification. However, it can be inferred that our product may actually be preferable because in status quo, the fumagillin beekeepers are using is mutagenic to mammals [1] which is not preferable for their farms and their customers. Beekeepers also seemed to be responsive to the idea that we were building on something from nature and enhancing it to help the bees. Beekeepers were concerned that the construct would change the taste or appearance of the honey. We would do this by providing a detailed explanation of what we are doing. Application: This means that our product would likely be well received.
