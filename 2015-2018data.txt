Basically, the benefits of melatonin have really conclusively in my personal opinion been only shown in jet lag and to some extent to the indication of Circadin at the moment.

One major topic was the insect toxin we had originally chosen as kill mechanisms of the S.H.I.E.L.D. When asked by Dr. Himmel about its properties, it became obvious that the data available was not sufficient to ensure the safe usage in our trap. We discussed how to deal with information on toxin-producing and -secreting bacteria with both Dr. Mirko Himmel and Piers Millett, iGEM Director of Safety and Security. In the environment, E. coli would no longer be provided with it, causing the production of the transcription factor to cease. Since genetically altered E. coli are only able to survive in the environment as a symbiosis with cyanobacteria and the survival of those in African climatic conditions is highly unlikely, Dr. Himmel agreed this would be a feasible approach to ensure our traps biosafety. We strongly suggest to implement this feature to anyone deciding to further develop our project before applying it for registration. When told about the S.H.I.E.L.D.âs approach, Dr. Jacobs assessed transfer of pathogens between landing mosquitoes to be very unlikely because even under laboratory circumstances the infection of mosquitoes is quite hard to achieve, and pathogens would not be able to survive for on the hydrogel for longer times. We interviewed multiple experts from Uganda and Tanzania, countries in which malaria still threatens many people despite significant efforts towards malaria elimination. He is postdoctoral researcher at the Imperial College in London. Dr. Andrew Hammond helped pushing our project further by sharing his expertise on project development and legislature with us. Specifically close to possible breeding sites, such as stagnant freshwater, close to bushes and on the outside of houses by eaves are optimal locations to ensure mosquitoes are eliminated before they get in contact with residents."  },  {    "Schools": "Hamburg",    "Section": "Overgraduate",    "Years": 2018,    "Wiki hyperlinks": "http://2018.igem.org/Team:Hamburg",    "Award": "",    "Outreach Category": "Integrated Human Practices",    "Event Names": "Student Research Center Hamburg",    "Project Tags": "Teaching Activity",    "Audiences": "Secondary School Students",    "Goals": "Education on Synthetic Biology, Present iGEM Project",    "Descriptions": "Since we know how important it is to spark interests at an early age, we wanted to promote knowledge about life sciences and synthetic biology, as well as share our passion for science in general.

This means that a treatment for Nosema is desperately needed if beekeeping is to continue to flourish. Application: This reassured us that our project was going to have an impact on our community because it is needed. We wanted to ensure that beekeepers really wanted a new product, so that we could be assured our product would be useful. But beekeepers also established that fumagillin was far from perfect, and so an alternative was needed regardless of its existence. This was because such research would affect a beekeeperâs organic certification. However, it can be inferred that our product may actually be preferable because in status quo, the fumagillin beekeepers are using is mutagenic to mammals [1] which is not preferable for their farms and their customers. Beekeepers also seemed to be responsive to the idea that we were building on something from nature and enhancing it to help the bees. Beekeepers were concerned that the construct would change the taste or appearance of the honey. We would do this by providing a detailed explanation of what we are doing.

Our team agreed on tackling the high number of vulvovaginal candidiasis misdiagnoses. It is a pH dependent test to distinguish between bacterial vaginosis and thrush. âAlexandra MÃ¶hringer, general practitioner, GermanyâI really like the idea of an easy-to-use test for detecting C. albicans since this would lead to a more targeted and therefore better therapy. My personal idea would be that if a person is treated with antibiotics (for example for treating a bladder infection) the test could be sold together with the antibiotics, since the risk is very high that the women will get a fungal infection due to overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms."  },  {    "Schools": "UiOslo Norway",    "Section": "Overgraduate",    "Years": 2018,    "Wiki hyperlinks": "http://2018.igem.org/Team:UiOslo_Norway",    "Award": "Nominated for Best Presentation, Overgrad",    "Outreach Category": "Integrated Human Practices",    "Event Names": "Conclusion",    "Project Tags": "Consult Experts",    "Audiences": "General Public",    "Goals": "Gain Information for iGEM Project",    "Descriptions": "The outcome of the questionnaire and the interviews with several experts was the crucial factor for us to start planning an educational campaign.

The framework was introduced to us by Dr Sarah Hartley, a social scientist at the University of Exeter. We wanted to use it to ensure that our project incorporates RRI (Responsible Research and Innovation). 1. AnticipateThis involves continuous consideration of how you want the innovation you are designing and introducing into society to shape the future of society. It's important to question in what ways you want your research to change the future and pay close attention to the associated risk and implications for society and the environment. It was important to gain information from stakeholders to help our understanding of the specific impacts of our project and then have internal meetings to discuss how we can act upon these. It also served a useful starting point for reflection. For example, interacting with Greenpeace allowed us to anticipate the issues surrounding the use of GM organisms in the field and the need for secure containment of any such organisms. We therefore began looking into methods for biosecurity. Click here for further information2. ReflectReflection is about considering the motivations behind a project to ensure the purpose of the research is fully understood. It involves thinking about the evolution of the project and most importantly ensuring that the research, and innovation, is still in line with the societal issue you want it to solve. Meetings with stakeholders often stimulated reflection, such as our meeting with a representative from Plymouth Marine Laboratory which allowed us to reflect on some of our initial ideas for our filtration system and refine them accordingly (Click here for further information). However, we generally found reflection was an internal process that allowed us to make educated decisions and allowed us to consider the broader questions surrounding our project. It also made it easier to identify the relevant stakeholders. 3. EngageThis part of the framework is about identifying and communicating with stakeholders who have expertise in the areas required to influence your research. A wide range of stakeholders and members of the general public should be involved to get a full range of perspectives. We found it important to find out as much as we could around our chosen research area before identifying the stakeholders who would be able to provide us with the knowledge we required. Maintaining a dialogue with stakeholders to ensure we continually engaged with them to utilise their expertise to help shape our project. Visiting the Veolia water treatment plant allowed us to engage with directly with the current stakeholders involved with tackling metal ion pollution from the Wheal Jane site. Click here for further information4. ActTo act is to take on board advice from stakeholders and actively use this information to influence and make changes to the project. It's important for researchers to remain flexible in their response, considering all views before change the trajectory of the project Throughout our project our decisions were highly influenced by direction gained from both academics and stakeholders. By giving our own RRI lectures to current Bioscience students we are enabling future research to be governed by the principles of RRI.
