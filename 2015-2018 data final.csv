But I think there is too little data available concerning the effects on giving melatonin to correct the imbalance in this disorders, there haven't been specific claims for melatonin disorders. Leon Bongers: The MEB and most regulatory authorities in Europe only work by paper. After their reply, we do a reassessment and a final decision is taken. Katrin: You told us that the EMA and, for example, the MEB have different medicines that they evaluate, so they don't interfere. But it might happen for example when a member state in Europe considers that a product does more harm than that it is efficacious. Taina Mattila: In principle, there is no specific risk in short-term use. But for example, the long-term risks with children are not completely known, for example for maturation. Basically, the benefits of melatonin have really conclusively in my personal opinion been only shown in jet lag and to some extent to the indication of Circadin at the moment. Katrin: I read that a side effect of taking melatonin is blood in the urine. When the company wanted it to be allowed, they only asked to allow it for the age of 55 years onwards. Can you imagine why they took this limit and not for example and didn't allow it for all adults?"

From our ï¬gures above, we could see that most people have fair awareness and their own proper thinking towards genetically modiï¬ed food, whether it is negative or positive, at least they are aware of the principle/basic theory of genetically modiï¬ed food and the process before they appear on the market. But still, about thirteen percent of people thought GM food might as well change our genes and cause us to transform into alternative creatures, which means they need more detailed information on this technology. Since this is actually a fairly possible hypothesis that we are all concerned about, we were really glad to see this result."

One major topic was the insect toxin we had originally chosen as kill mechanisms of the S.H.I.E.L.D. When asked by Dr. Himmel about its properties, it became obvious that the data available was not sufficient to ensure the safe usage in our trap. We discussed how to deal with information on toxin-producing and -secreting bacteria with both Dr. Mirko Himmel and Piers Millett, iGEM Director of Safety and Security. In the environment, E. coli would no longer be provided with it, causing the production of the transcription factor to cease. Since genetically altered E. coli are only able to survive in the environment as a symbiosis with cyanobacteria and the survival of those in African climatic conditions is highly unlikely, Dr. Himmel agreed this would be a feasible approach to ensure our traps biosafety. We strongly suggest to implement this feature to anyone deciding to further develop our project before applying it for registration. When told about the S.H.I.E.L.D.âs approach, Dr. Jacobs assessed transfer of pathogens between landing mosquitoes to be very unlikely because even under laboratory circumstances the infection of mosquitoes is quite hard to achieve, and pathogens would not be able to survive for on the hydrogel for longer times. We interviewed multiple experts from Uganda and Tanzania, countries in which malaria still threatens many people despite significant efforts towards malaria elimination. He is postdoctoral researcher at the Imperial College in London. Dr. Andrew Hammond helped pushing our project further by sharing his expertise on project development and legislature with us. Specifically close to possible breeding sites, such as stagnant freshwater, close to bushes and on the outside of houses by eaves are optimal locations to ensure mosquitoes are eliminated before they get in contact with residents."

We knew that we needed to talk to those who worked with bees on a government level and take into account government regulations.

Firstly, we wanted to discover the ways in which our project would affect the community. Quotes: âWeâve experienced crashing in the spring from bees that heavy Nosema Levelsâ - Curtis MiedemaAnswer: Overwhelmingly beekeepers told us that Nosema has a very negative impact on their operations, because Nosema kills and as Curtis says, âless bees means less honeyâ. This means that a treatment for Nosema is desperately needed if beekeeping is to continue to flourish. Application: This reassured us that our project was going to have an impact on our community because it is needed. We wanted to ensure that beekeepers really wanted a new product, so that we could be assured our product would be useful. But beekeepers also established that fumagillin was far from perfect, and so an alternative was needed regardless of its existence. This was because such research would affect a beekeeperâs organic certification. However, it can be inferred that our product may actually be preferable because in status quo, the fumagillin beekeepers are using is mutagenic to mammals [1] which is not preferable for their farms and their customers. Beekeepers also seemed to be responsive to the idea that we were building on something from nature and enhancing it to help the bees. Beekeepers were concerned that the construct would change the taste or appearance of the honey. We would do this by providing a detailed explanation of what we are doing. Application: This means that our product would likely be well received. They also told us that as long as it worked, they would use it as the is an immediate need for a solution."

Exeter,Overgraduate,2017,http://2017.igem.org/Team:Exeter,,Integrated Human Practices,,"Consult Experts, Educational Material",iGEM Teams,Gain Information for iGEM project,"This year we have implemented the AREA framework created by Professor Richard Owen. The framework was introduced to us by Dr Sarah Hartley, a social scientist at the University of Exeter. We wanted to use it to ensure that our project incorporates RRI (Responsible Research and Innovation). 1. AnticipateThis involves continuous consideration of how you want the innovation you are designing and introducing into society to shape the future of society. It's important to question in what ways you want your research to change the future and pay close attention to the associated risk and implications for society and the environment. It was important to gain information from stakeholders to help our understanding of the specific impacts of our project and then have internal meetings to discuss how we can act upon these. It also served a useful starting point for reflection. For example, interacting with Greenpeace allowed us to anticipate the issues surrounding the use of GM organisms in the field and the need for secure containment of any such organisms. We therefore began looking into methods for biosecurity. Click here for further information2. ReflectReflection is about considering the motivations behind a project to ensure the purpose of the research is fully understood. It involves thinking about the evolution of the project and most importantly ensuring that the research, and innovation, is still in line with the societal issue you want it to solve. Meetings with stakeholders often stimulated reflection, such as our meeting with a representative from Plymouth Marine Laboratory which allowed us to reflect on some of our initial ideas for our filtration system and refine them accordingly (Click here for further information). However, we generally found reflection was an internal process that allowed us to make educated decisions and allowed us to consider the broader questions surrounding our project. It also made it easier to identify the relevant stakeholders. 3. EngageThis part of the framework is about identifying and communicating with stakeholders who have expertise in the areas required to influence your research. A wide range of stakeholders and members of the general public should be involved to get a full range of perspectives. We found it important to find out as much as we could around our chosen research area before identifying the stakeholders who would be able to provide us with the knowledge we required. Maintaining a dialogue with stakeholders to ensure we continually engaged with them to utilise their expertise to help shape our project. Visiting the Veolia water treatment plant allowed us to engage with directly with the current stakeholders involved with tackling metal ion pollution from the Wheal Jane site. Click here for further information4. ActTo act is to take on board advice from stakeholders and actively use this information to influence and make changes to the project. It's important for researchers to remain flexible in their response, considering all views before change the trajectory of the project Throughout our project our decisions were highly influenced by direction gained from both academics and stakeholders. By giving our own RRI lectures to current Bioscience students we are enabling future research to be governed by the principles of RRI. Click here for further information"
