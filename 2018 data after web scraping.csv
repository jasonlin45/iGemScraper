2,Aachen,Overgrad,2018,Gold,"Nominated for Best Hardware, Overgrad",http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen,Integrated Human Practices,Interview with Leon Bongers and Tania Mattila about melatonin as medication and its approval.,We talked with Leon Bongers and Tania Mattila from the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) about the process of approval for Melatonin in the Netherlands and in the European Union. Leon Bongers is responsible for the approval of melatonin as a medicine in the Netherlands.
3,Aachen,Overgrad,2018,Gold,"Nominated for Best Hardware, Overgrad",http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen,Integrated Human Practices,The Interview,"Katrin: Have you heard about the correlation between Melatonin and neurological disorders, like depression, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease and fibromyalgia? But I think there is too little data available concerning the effects on giving melatonin to correct the imbalance in this disorders, there haven't been specific claims for melatonin disorders. Leon Bongers: The MEB and most regulatory authorities in Europe only work by paper. After their reply, we do a reassessment and a final decision is taken. Katrin: You told us that the EMA and, for example, the MEB have different medicines that they evaluate, so they don't interfere. But it might happen for example when a member state in Europe considers that a product does more harm than that it is efficacious. Taina Mattila: In principle, there is no specific risk in short-term use. But for example, the long-term risks with children are not completely known, for example for maturation. Basically, the benefits of melatonin have really conclusively in my personal opinion been only shown in jet lag and to some extent to the indication of Circadin at the moment. Katrin: I read that a side effect of taking melatonin is blood in the urine. When the company wanted it to be allowed, they only asked to allow it for the age of 55 years onwards. Can you imagine why they took this limit and not for example and didn't allow it for all adults?"

Especially, the sharing of experiences and failures would help us later on in our journey."
6,Aachen,Overgrad,2018,Gold,"Nominated for Best Hardware, Overgrad",http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen,Integrated Human Practices,The first steps towards a certain project idea,"In February 2018 we started brainstorming to find a project that could potentially transform people’s lives. The stunning findings in the past decades revealed a strong correlation with numerous diseases, so our biosensor could speed up the diagnosis of multiple diseases."
7,Aachen,Overgrad,2018,Gold,"Nominated for Best Hardware, Overgrad",http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen,Integrated Human Practices,Getting insights from a medical doctor,"Dr. Groezinger is a senior physician in the psychiatric polyclinic. He explained to us how a melatonin sample is taken: traditionally, saliva samples are used, since there is a linear correlation of melatonin concentration in serum and saliva. Dr. Groezingers point of view, the high cost of an adequate number of melatonin measurements is the reason for the rare usage of this diagnostic method."
8,Aachen,Overgrad,2018,Gold,"Nominated for Best Hardware, Overgrad",http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen,Integrated Human Practices,presenting and discussing ideas at the institute for bio and geo sciences,"After weeks of research on the detection of melatonin in the human body, we came up with three possible mechanisms to use in our biosensor. Because of this, it would not be specific enough and evidence that the detected signal came from melatonin would not be given."
9,Aachen,Overgrad,2018,Gold,"Nominated for Best Hardware, Overgrad",http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen,Integrated Human Practices,Using luciferase under the control of the Estrogen Response Element as reporter,"During our first months of research we noticed a research group in the Aalto University (Helsinki), who developed a yeast-cell based assay for the detection of different analytes, i. e. Estrogen, using different nuclear receptors. We decided, that the system would be suitable for our project, as we also planned to use the specific nuclear receptor RZR (Retinoid-related orphan receptor-beta) for the detection of melatonin."
10,Aachen,Overgrad,2018,Gold,"Nominated for Best Hardware, Overgrad",http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen,Integrated Human Practices,Status quo of melatonin measurements,"While working on our biological approach using living cells to detect melatonin in saliva samples, the next logical step was to gather the opinion of the people that are ultimately going to perform the measurements - medical laboratories. The most commonly used method for melatonin measurements is Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). We also were interested in whether these laboratories use living cells for their measurements. Regarding Dr. Josef van Helden, the best solution for a melatonin measurement would be a device that could be placed in the doctor's office."
11,Aachen,Overgrad,2018,Gold,"Nominated for Best Hardware, Overgrad",http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen,Integrated Human Practices,Talking with the expert in melatonin research,"Dr. Dario Acuña works at the University of Granada in Spain and is the leading scientist in the field of melatonin research. Whereas ELISA works perfectly for melatonin metabolites in urine, it is not as specific in blood or saliva. Dr. Acuña stated that mass spectrometry is the most accurate technique but is yet very expensive compared to ELISA and HPLC. Accordingly, we asked about the best fluid to measure the melatonin level. Furthermore, we learned about the process of measuring the melatonin levels. Usually, Dr. Acuna takes six samples of saliva of one patient and uses five assays of ELISA. Except for mass spectrometry, the current techniques are standard scientific methods but have a lack of sensitivity."

But this would prohibit using normal commercial litography systems like UV-litography which are state of the art right now. The space inside these machines prohibits placing long fibers in them. During the discussion, we changed our setup from placing the Au nano structure on top of the fiber to placing it on standard glass wafers."
14,Aachen,Overgrad,2018,Gold,"Nominated for Best Hardware, Overgrad",http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen,Integrated Human Practices,Suggestions for further improvements,"Taking all the feedback into account, our project does not have to end just yet. We could engineer some improvements to our technique to make it market-ready. In the future, the measurement of those hormones could be integrated in the regular health check to raise awareness of the importance of hormone balance."

32,BJRS China,High_school,2018,Gold,,http://2018.igem.org/Team:BJRS_China,Education and Public Engagement,Report on Questionnaire ,"To investigate public’s cognition state and acceptance level on genetically modiﬁed food(referred as GM food in parts of the article below), we set up this questionnaire. Therefore, this survey has certain universality and representativeness. Ninety-eight were very concerned and 83 were less concerned; Fifteen people don't pay any attention. From our ﬁgures above, we could see that most people have fair awareness and their own proper thinking towards genetically modiﬁed food, whether it is negative or positive, at least they are aware of the principle/basic theory of genetically modiﬁed food and the process before they appear on the market. But still, about thirteen percent of people thought GM food might as well change our genes and cause us to transform into alternative creatures, which means they need more detailed information on this technology. Since this is actually a fairly possible hypothesis that we are all concerned about, we were really glad to see this result."
33,BJRS China,High_school,2018,Gold,,http://2018.igem.org/Team:BJRS_China,Education and Public Engagement,Feedback on school presentations,"Through our questionnaire feedback, we found that the public still had some misunderstandings about synthetic biology and genetically modified methods, so we decided to conduct a school lecture. In this case, we should take the current situation of development and popularization into account and make corresponding changes and efforts."
34,BJRS China,High_school,2018,Gold,,http://2018.igem.org/Team:BJRS_China,Education and Public Engagement,About the idea,"The audience's thoughts on the application field are concentrated in the related fields of medicine, biology, pharmacy and so on, which is also what the scientists are aiming at. Synthetic biology is also closely related to sociology and social production, although the public is less involved, and there are already studies and partial production of bioenergy and biological products. of course there are also many disputes, sometimes technical level can achieve, but the moral and ethical will limit its reality, so in the process of the application of synthetic biology, still have many difficulties to be overcome, is not only a technical, there are some social factors, involves many interdisciplinary areas. To sum up, the development of synthetic biology is more in line with the public expectation and faces some problems."

These individuals work closely with families and patients to provide support and encourage spiritual well-being, whether it be through active listening or the provision of rituals or ceremonies. Ultimately, it was determined that our team was not equipped to fully counter the negative connotations and safety concerns that accompany the project’s therapeutic applications on a large-scale."
40,Calgary,Undergrad,2018,Gold,Nominated for Best Software Tool,http://2018.igem.org/Team:Calgary,Integrated Human Practices,Conclusion,"Ultimately, our project direction was swayed by the feedback which we received through our human practices work. Therefore, we addressed those issues within the context of a research platform as opposed to tackling the baggage associated with gene therapy."

Colonoscopy is an invasive method that requires the patient to adapt food intake and to use laxatives prior to the examination (Simon, 2016). The colonography is semi-invasive but still requires the patient to prepare for the examination as for the colonoscopy (Simon, 2016). The drawbacks of these tests are that they have a low detection rate of precancerous lesions and that they can give false results as a consequence of diet (Simon, 2016)."

The reason why we wanted to have a meeting with Karl de Fine Licht is that he has worked with bioethics, and we thought he could give us some important views on our project and hopefully some good advice, which was also the case. In an experimental survey, the respondents are handed a scenario in which they have to take different stand points. By creating the same scenario but describing it in two separate ways, it is possible to see if people react differently depending on how the scenario is described."

Most of the participants were relatively young, ranging from 14 to 30 years old, which is why we considered that the vast majority of the survey was filled out online. Interestingly, independent of age, gender and degree, most of the participants are aware that the intestinal flora has an impact on human health. This became obvious to us at the supermarket, when looking at the people struggling to answer this question. This clearly indicates that the public is still not very familiar with synthetic biology and its potential benefits."

One major topic was the insect toxin we had originally chosen as kill mechanisms of the S.H.I.E.L.D. When asked by Dr. Himmel about its properties, it became obvious that the data available was not sufficient to ensure the safe usage in our trap. We discussed how to deal with information on toxin-producing and -secreting bacteria with both Dr. Mirko Himmel and Piers Millett, iGEM Director of Safety and Security. In the environment, E. coli would no longer be provided with it, causing the production of the transcription factor to cease. Since genetically altered E. coli are only able to survive in the environment as a symbiosis with cyanobacteria and the survival of those in African climatic conditions is highly unlikely, Dr. Himmel agreed this would be a feasible approach to ensure our traps biosafety. We strongly suggest to implement this feature to anyone deciding to further develop our project before applying it for registration. When told about the S.H.I.E.L.D.’s approach, Dr. Jacobs assessed transfer of pathogens between landing mosquitoes to be very unlikely because even under laboratory circumstances the infection of mosquitoes is quite hard to achieve, and pathogens would not be able to survive for on the hydrogel for longer times. We interviewed multiple experts from Uganda and Tanzania, countries in which malaria still threatens many people despite significant efforts towards malaria elimination. He is postdoctoral researcher at the Imperial College in London. Dr. Andrew Hammond helped pushing our project further by sharing his expertise on project development and legislature with us.

However, there are also possibilities that these differences are purely due to the fact that there are views to the issues that the public did not originally consider. Impacts on human health that renewable energy might potentially cause are the low-frequency waves caused by the wind turbines in wind farms or the toxic and carcinogenic chemicals released during the manufacturing processes. As a result, the next focus on our MFC moderation will be on the possible pollutants that the MFC might produce during its electricity generation."

Through our brain storming and preliminary research sessions, we realized that a project on bees would be the best way to do this. Crops such as blueberries, almonds, and many more were affected. We knew that we needed to talk to those who worked with bees on a government level and take into account government regulations. We also recognized the need to speak with the people who once produced Fumagilin and wanted to get involved with beekeeping at a corporate level."

Firstly, we wanted to discover the ways in which our project would affect the community. Quotes: “We’ve experienced crashing in the spring from bees that heavy Nosema Levels” - Curtis MiedemaAnswer: Overwhelmingly beekeepers told us that Nosema has a very negative impact on their operations, because Nosema kills and as Curtis says, “less bees means less honey”. This means that a treatment for Nosema is desperately needed if beekeeping is to continue to flourish. Application: This reassured us that our project was going to have an impact on our community because it is needed. We wanted to ensure that beekeepers really wanted a new product, so that we could be assured our product would be useful. But beekeepers also established that fumagillin was far from perfect, and so an alternative was needed regardless of its existence. This was because such research would affect a beekeeper’s organic certification. However, it can be inferred that our product may actually be preferable because in status quo, the fumagillin beekeepers are using is mutagenic to mammals [1] which is not preferable for their farms and their customers. Beekeepers also seemed to be responsive to the idea that we were building on something from nature and enhancing it to help the bees. Beekeepers were concerned that the construct would change the taste or appearance of the honey. We would do this by providing a detailed explanation of what we are doing. Application: This means that our product would likely be well received. They also told us that as long as it worked, they would use it as the is an immediate need for a solution."
