Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Interview with Leon Bongers and Tania Mattila about melatonin as medication and its approval.,"
											We talked with Leon Bongers and Tania Mattila from the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) about the process of approval 
											for Melatonin in the Netherlands and in the European Union. 
											We learned that the availability of melatonin could only change through pressure of pharmaceutical companies. 
											They also dicussed with us the chances and risks of melatonin supplementation.
											We were very surprised that there is such a strict regulation of the availability of melatonin in our country.  
											Circadin is a prescription medication containing melatonin, which has been approved in the whole European Union from the age of 55. 
											In Germany, in contrast to other countries, melatonin products as dietary supplements are strictly regulated, while in our neighbour country the Netherlands, 
											they are freely available. 
											We learned from the IGJ (Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd), the responsible institution for the approval of dietary supplements in the Netherlands, 
											that a melatonin-containing product is only considered a medicine if it contains at least 0,3 mg of melatonin and claims to cure a disease. 
											
											Our team member Katrin interviewed clinical assessor Tania Mattila and Leon Bongers, the Senior Regulatory Project Leader of Pharmacotherapeutic Group I, 
											both from the MEB. Leon Bongers is responsible for the approval of melatonin as a medicine in the Netherlands. 
											He and Mrs. Mattila explained to us that in the Netherlands it is assumed that the population only takes melatonin after 
											consultation with a doctor and that the number of studies on melatonin for 
											short-term use is sufficient since there are no worrying side effects when taken correctly, 
											but there are not enough studies on melatonin for a longer period. In addition, 
											we learned that it is apparently not enough to raise general awareness to the positive effects of melatonin in the society. 
											An amendment to the law in Germany could only be achieved by pressure from the pharmaceutical industry. 
											Then, melatonin could be available in Germany for humans under fifty-five, too. 
											To learn more about the process of drug approval in the EU and to inform yourself about the risks and when it is reasonable to supplement melatonin, 
											please read our interview below."
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,The Interview,"
											Katrin: Have you heard about the correlation between Melatonin and neurological disorders, like depression, Parkinson's,
											Alzheimer's disease and fibromyalgia?
											
											Leon Bongers: We know that a melatonin disbalance can play a role in many disorders like the ones that you mentioned. 
											But I think there is too little data available concerning the effects on giving melatonin to correct the imbalance in this disorders,
											there haven't been specific claims for melatonin disorders. 
											So it hasn't played a part in the authorization application that we have had so far.
											
											Katrin: We think it would be interesting to know more about the process of the medical authorization in the CBG and also how 
											you work together with the EU.
											
											Leon Bongers: The MEB and most regulatory authorities in Europe only work by paper. 
											The tests are being done by a pharmaceutical company that often relies completely on papers and literature. 
											A company submits to us a dossier with detail on the manufacturing, indication, and safety of the product.
											Then the application is assessed by different specialized assessment groups, for example, clinical assessors like Taina, 
											but there is also a non-clinical assessment. The assessors make reports which are scheduled for a board meeting. 
											The MEB consists mainly of two parts, the board with about 17 highly educated professors who are making the final decision 
											on an application, and the drafters of the report, me as a regulator et cetera who are doing the work and prepare the reports for 
											the board. There the assessment is discussed and we mostly draw a list of questions to the company which they have to answer. 
											After their reply, we do a reassessment and a final decision is taken.
											But a lot of decisions are made in the EU. I just talked about the national procedure, 
											that's when a company decides to make an application in only one member state, like for melatonin supplementation. 
											But for example, Circadin, as a product that is registered in all member states of the European Union, has a centralized procedure. 
											It means that an application is made in all member states at the same time and an assessment is done by one member state. 
											They draw out a report which is being discussed on a European level in a specific meeting at the EMA [European Medicines Agency]. 
											A company also has the option to make the applications only in a few member states, 
											then one member state will make reports which are circulated to the other member states and are asked what they think of the assessments.
											
											Katrin: You told us that the EMA and, for example, the MEB have different medicines that they evaluate, 
											so they don't interfere. But if the MEB authorized a medicine, could the EMA object to it?
											
											Leon Bongers: Normally the EMA or another member state is not even aware of such a decision. 
											We issue marketing authorizations to a company. But it might happen for example when a member state in Europe considers 
											that a product does more harm than that it is efficacious. Then the member state has the opportunity to refer a commission in Europe, 
											the CHMP, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. 
											The CHMP advises the European Commission which can take the final decision on whether a medicinal product can be used for a certain indication.
											Katrin: Could you say something about the risks of taking melatonin as a supplement without a physician's advice, 
											or are there also benefits?
											
											Taina Mattila: In principle, there is no specific risk in short-term use. But for example, 
											the long-term risks with children are not completely known, for example for maturation. 
											And I think when you take melatonin in the wrong way or in a wrong time it can also influence your own circadian rhythm. 
											In that way, it can be harmful.
											Taking melatonin for a sleep problem might deprive yourself of an effective treatment that a physician could be able to give to you. 
											Soft measures for improving sleep could be nightly rituals and other non-medicinal measures. 
											Basically, the benefits of melatonin have really conclusively in my personal opinion been only shown in jet lag and to some extent 
											to the indication of Circadin at the moment. 
											So if you ask about short-term safety risks we are not that worried, but we are with using it for a long time and with indications where 
											it might not have any kind of effects.
											
											Katrin: I read that a side effect of taking melatonin is blood in the urine. Do you know where that comes from?
											
											Taina Mattila: Unfortunately I don't know. But of course melatonin is a hormone, 
											that is involved in a lot of different systems in the body and has the potential to affect them.
											
											Katrin: Circadin is only allowed from the age of 55 years onwards. When the company wanted it to be allowed, 
											they only asked to allow it for the age of 55 years onwards. Can you imagine why 
											they took this limit and not for example and didn't allow it for all adults?
											
											Taina Mattila: The main large trial was performed in patients over 55 years of age. 
											So the data for lower age groups was not available to such an extent that it could be approvable. 
											There was a lot of discussion in the CHMP and in the end, it was approved with a majority decision. 
											You should also know that the indication is specifically for insomnia characterized by poor sleep quality. 
											So it is not an overall insomnia indication and it is limited to age.
											
											Katrin: Is there a discussion about lowering the age limit?
											
											Leon Bongers: In general one can say that the age limit will not shift as long as the company is not asking for 
											it because a change or an application is made by a company. 
											And as long as a company does nothing, the age limit will not change. 
											So they have to substantiate why the age limit could be lower. But I think they have no chance of lowering it in normal healthy people.
											
											Taina Mattila: They would be asked to show some new data for it, so I don't think the company is interested in doing studies for that.
											
											Katrin: I recently read that Germany said that that there are not so many studies, and also there are no long-term studies. 
											What can you tell me about it?
											
											Taina Mattila: There are many studies being done, some positive, some negative. 
											In most kinds of sleep disorders, the efficacy is inconclusive. It is unclear whether the effects are clinically relevant. 
											So, for example, a patient falls asleep 10 minutes faster than he does normally, 
											does it have an effect on the patient's wellbeing or functioning? What is the threshold how much faster you have to fall asleep in order to improve your quality of life? 
											What I've seen so far is that in jetlag there is the strongest evidence of efficacy.
											
											Katrin: Did you hear that taking Melatonin could be also beneficial for shift workers and have you heard of other benefits?
											
											Taina Mattila: On shiftwork, there is not enough evidence for efficacy based on what I have seen in the literature.
											
											Leon Bongers: There is EFSA, that's the European authority for food products and supplements. 
											They have decided on the indication of the reduction of sleep onset [the time you are still awake after going to bed]. 
											It seems that it is indeed reduced by melatonin. But so far the MEB has not accepted the sleep onset time reduction as an indication for a 
											medicinal product and therefore it cannot be registered for this indication. 
											But there was a lot of discussion in the MEB. So far we have not accepted it as an indication for melatonin as a medicinal product. 
											But it's the most important reason to use it as a supplement."
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Interview with a local radio station,"Bringing synthetic biology, iGEM and our project to the public eye is a big part of human practices. 
											On August 1st we met with a local radio station, the ""Hochschulradio"", in Aachen and had an interview with them. 
											We had the opportunity to present our project und talk about the importance of melatonin to a wide audience. 
											Furthermore we talked about iGEM and what it means to us. "
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Informing public personae about iGEM,"
											On September 7, 2018, we met Emmanuelle Marie Charpentier at the Aachen Engineering Award. 
											She impressed and motivated us very much with her work and her character. 
											It was not only the first time that a woman, but also a person with a biological and chemical background was awarded this prize. 
											This has given us additional confidence for the future in the role of biosciences and equality.
											Besides that, we briefly presented our project and iGEM to Klaus Radermacher, Head of Medical Technology at RWTH University, 
											and to the new Rector Ulrich Rüdiger.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,German Meetup,"
												After a long period of researching, we finally met most of the German iGEM-teams in June at Marburg. 
												We not only got to know many inspiring people, but also had the opportunity to discuss our projects with them. 
												Especially, the sharing of experiences and failures would help us later on in our journey. 
												Furthermore, various scientists and organizations joined the meetup and presented to us their experiences and advice. 
												We learned how to handle steps backwards and how they can improve a scientist's work. 
												A big thanks to the iGEM team Marburg for organizing and hosting this great event!
												"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,European Meetup," Only one month after the meetup in Marburg we went to the European meetup 
												in Munich where we had a great time. We had the chance to meet the German teams again as well as meeting even 
												more awesome young researchers, in particularly, the iGEM team of Utrecht with whom we started a collaboration afterwards. 
												In addition, we met a bunch of scientists and entrepreneurs who shared their wisdom with us. 
												We listened to talks about current topics in the field of synthetic biology and learned new skills at workshops. 
												We thank iGEM LMU and TU Munich for the organization of this thrilling weekend!
												"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,meeting prospective researchers,"
											""Jugend Forscht"" encourages and inspires scientifically talented young people under the age of 21. 
											Like the iGEM competition, young students develop a project and throughout the 
											competition meet up with entrepreneurs, scientists and other qualified people to improve their idea. 
											It is Germany’s greatest competition in promoting young scientists. 
											In May, a group of participants visited our laboratories and discussed their ideas with us.
											Additionally, we presented our project and Marco, one of our advisors, gave them a tour through our laboratories. 
											Seeing young people who have this level of interest in sciences and new approaches to current issues was an inspiring 
											and reassuring experience. We wish them success in the competition!
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Teaching the basics of microbiology,"To meet the challenges of the future, biologic applications are going to be more and more relevant. Thus, it is essential to make this work field interesting for young people. With a school project, we tried to make the field of synthetic biology more appealing for them. 
											Since we were very surprised about the major role of melatonin in the human body and the little familiarity in the public, we took this opportunity to inform our audience. 
											At the beginning of September, we went to 10th-grade students at the Herzogenrath Highschool to show them the fundamentals of lab work. We carried out the lessons on three different days.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,First day:,"At the beginning of the first day, we presented the schedule for the upcoming one and a half weeks. After a small introduction about us, we talk about safety in a laboratory, working sterile and different media types for the cultivation of microorganisms. We split the class into groups of four students. First, the students weighed out the different components to prepare a YPD medium in Petri dishes. We autoclaved the media and explained the physical principles of autoclavation. In the end, the pupil poured the YPD medium into the Petri dishes."
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Second day:,"On the second day, the students inoculated the Petri dishes. Every group had four Petri dishes: one plate which was exposed to the air, another which was used to test the effect of ampicillin on the growth of microorganisms, and another two where they could test the contamination of different surfaces. Furthermore, we explained the functionality of antibiotics. The plates were incubated at 30°C."
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,"
","Seven days later we evaluated the plates and talked about the different organisms that grew on the Petri dishes. To get a closer look, we used a light microscope to analyze how their morphology was multifaceted. After the students finished their drawings, we presented our project. The students were very interested in the topic and we continued discussing about synthetic biology and the different fields of research."
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,German Academic Exchange Service,"
											On 20th September a polish student group visited the RWTH with the help of the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service). 
											We had the possibility to present our project along with other scientists from the Abbt Schwaneberg Institute. 
											We talked about  what iGEM is in general, the challenges and opportunities an iGEM project gives and what our project 
											this year is particularly about. The students were very interested and had many different questions.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,movement for evidence-based politics and free research,"
											On April 14th, we went to Cologne to attend the ""March for Science"". 
											With self-made signs and banners our goal was to draw attention to the importance of science in our society. 
											Fake-news, alternative-facts and populism raise fear and antipathy against research. To deal with those problems, 
											speeches on science were given. Speakers included science-journalist Ranga Yogeshwar and criminal-biologist Mark Benecke among others. 
											After this inspiring event, we used the possibility to get to know the iGEM-teams from Duesseldorf and Bielefeld and exchanged 
											ideas and visions about our projects.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,The first steps towards a certain project idea,"
											In February 2018 we started brainstorming to find a project that could potentially transform people’s lives. 
											Ranging from a car fueled by hydrogen produced by cyanobacteria, 
											over the decrease of the detection-time of slowly growing pathogenic bacteria we had plenty of ideas. 
											We saw the greatest potential in the simplification of the diagnosis of a melatonin underproduction since the current measurement takes up to six weeks. 
											One of our team members, Biel Badia Roigé, had already experienced this issue. 
											The stunning findings in the past decades revealed a strong correlation with numerous diseases, 
											so our biosensor could speed up the diagnosis of multiple diseases. The idea of a faster, 
											cheaper and more versatile method of melatonin-measurement also resonated with our PI’s Dr. Wiechert, Dr. Schwaneberg and Dr. Bank. 
											Our first milestone was achieved.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Getting insights from a medical doctor,"
											Prof. Dr. Groezinger is a senior physician in the psychiatric polyclinic. 
											Some of his research fields are sleep physiology and sleep medicine as well as sleep and affective disorders. 
											He also is a member of the European Sleep Research Society.
											We visited him to learn about the use of melatonin measurement as a diagnostic marker in different diseases. 
											We were shocked to hear that the  University Hospital Aachen - being one of the largest 
											clinics in Europe  - does not perform any melatonin measurements. 
											Samples for melatonin measurement have to be shipped to a medical laboratory 73 km away, 
											to the Stein Labor in Moenchengladbach. 
											He explained to us how a melatonin sample is taken: traditionally, saliva samples are used, 
											since there is a linear correlation of melatonin concentration in serum and saliva. 
											The melatonin concentration found in saliva is 30% the concentration found in serum. 
											Patients have to collect the samples themselves at home. At 2 a.m. 
											they have to interrupt their sleep to give a saliva sample into the tubes they were provided with.
											Taking just one sample is very inaccurate to deliver a substantiated diagnosis, 
											but the financial restrictions are a great barrier for medical professionals for analyzing multiple samples. 
											As we got to know later from a leading scientist in the field of melatonin research, Dr. Dario Acuña, 
											for a reliable diagnosis, six samples, given with a two hours break in between each sample, are necessary. 
											From Prof. Dr. Groezingers point of view, the high cost of an adequate number of melatonin measurements is the reason 
											for the rare usage of this diagnostic method. Therefore the internal laboratory of the University Hospital 
											Aachen does not gather a sufficient amount of samples to make melatonin 
											measurements cost-efficient - the most widely used assay for melatonin 
											measurement is the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and it is mostly available in 96-well strip plates.
											For further infromation on different laboratory methods for melatonin measurement 
											read our article about Dr. Dario Acuña."
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,presenting and discussing ideas at the institute for bio and geo sciences,"
											After weeks of research on the detection of melatonin in the human body, 
											we came up with three possible mechanisms to use in our biosensor.
											

											On May 7th, we went to Juelich Research Center to discuss those ideas with experts, 
											to see which approach is most suitable in our project and to work out what difficulties we would have to face. 
											After a warm welcome of Michael Osthege, a former iGEM-Team member of RWTH Aachen in 2014 and 2015, 
											and some basic chat about how to organize the team, we went to see Dr. S. Binder, founder of SenseUp, who gave insights into his StartUp.
											Afterwards, we presented our ideas to Prof. M. Pohl (biocatalysis and biosensors), Jun.-Prof. D. Kohlheyer (Microscale Bioengineering), 
											Dr. Drepper from Institute for Molecular Enzyme Technology IMET (Bacterial Photobiotechnology) and 
											Dr. J. Marienhagen (Synthetic Cell-factories).With their advice, we figured out that using the cascade would be too time-consuming and unspecific. 
											The fewer components, the better because intermediate steps work as a black-box for us. 
											We would not be able to see if other substances interfered with our receptor in between. 
											Furthermore, if we did not have a signal at all, we would have serious difficulties to localize the steps, 
											where problems could occur. Because of this, it would not be specific enough and evidence that the detected signal 
											came from melatonin would not be given. In addition, we learned that using living cells for quantitative measurement could be tricky. 
											We decided to focus on beta-arrestin binding and on RZR and to abolish the idea of a G-protein coupled cascade.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Using luciferase under the control of the Estrogen Response Element as reporter,"During our first months of research we noticed a research group in the Aalto University (Helsinki), 
											who developed a yeast-cell based assay for the detection of different analytes, i. e. Estrogen, using different nuclear receptors.  
											We decided, that the system would be suitable for our project, as we also planned to use the specific nuclear receptor RZR 
											(Retinoid-related orphan receptor-beta) for the detection of melatonin.  
											After contacting the research group, they directly send us their modified strain (BMA64-1A), 
											so that we could use the integrated firefly luciferase gene as a reporter under the control of the Estrogen Response Element (ERE).
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Status quo of melatonin measurements,"
											While working on our biological approach using living cells to detect melatonin in saliva samples, 
											the next logical step was to gather the opinion of the people that are ultimately going to perform the measurements - 
											medical laboratories.
											Dr. med. Josef van Helden leads the department of endocrinological measurements in the Stein Labor 
											(German for laboratory) in Moenchengladbach and was kind enough to have an interview with us.
											Since we were concerned about whether tubes, in which saliva samples are given, need a special coating, 
											we got Dr. Josef van Helden’s opinion in this. In his lab, salivettes are primarily used, 
											considering they are easy to use for the patient (a fiber roll is placed inside the mouth to soak it with saliva, 
											and then it's placed back inside the tube). But the tubes itself does not have a special coating, 
											because melatonin does not react with polyethylene.
											For a melatonin measurement serum, saliva or urine can be used. 
											Since saliva delivers reliable measurement results and is most convenient.
											Concerning the transport conditions, patients have to make sure, that their saliva sample is transported under 10°C. 
											If saliva samples are saved at a temperature under -20°C, they can be stored for a long period of time.
											The most commonly used method for melatonin measurements is Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). 
											High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPCL) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) are two further 
											methods that are used for melatonin measurements, but since they are costly they are not the preferred choice. 
											We got further insides about the advantages and disadvantages of the sensitivity of these methods from Dr. Dario Acuña. 
											ELISA is mostly available in 96-well strip plates. If fewer samples are analyzed than a kit offers, 
											it is inherently linked to a higher cost per sample. Thus, laboratories wait till 96 samples are gathered. 
											In case this takes a long time, the patient has a long waiting time till the results of their measurement are available. 
											Especially in the case of melatonin, this is a relevant point.
											We also were interested in whether these laboratories use living cells for their measurements. 
											Some measurements are performed with living cells, so our biological approach could indeed be used in medical laboratories.
											Regarding Dr. Josef van Helden, the best solution for a melatonin measurement would be a device that could be placed in the doctor's office. 
											The point of care diagnostic is a growing market, but there is no device yet, that allows to instantaneous measurements of melatonin.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Talking with the expert in melatonin research," 
											Prof. Dr. Dario Acuña works at the University of Granada in Spain and is the leading scientist in the field of melatonin research. 
											He was the first researcher who investigated melatonin and its effects in the 1980s. During our research, 
											we read many of his scientific papers. Therefore, we wanted to interview him. 
											Due to the interview, we decided to use saliva samples for melatonin measurement. 
											Moreover, it marked the start of our hardware project.  
											First of all, we discussed current melatonin measurement methods. 
											The most common methods are ELISA, HPLC and UPLC combined with mass spectrometry. 
											Depending on the sample fluid (blood, saliva or urine) each method has its benefits and drawbacks. 
											Whereas ELISA works perfectly for melatonin metabolites in urine, it is not as specific in blood or saliva. 
											There again, HPCL is often used for high levels of melatonin in blood. These high levels, however, only occur rarely. 
											Dr. Acuña stated that mass spectrometry is the most accurate technique but is yet very expensive compared to ELISA and HPLC. 
											Mass spectrometry is not a standard detection method and therefore only few laboratories can use this sensitive technique.  
											Accordingly, we asked about the best fluid to measure the melatonin level. 
											He explained that saliva would be the best one, as it contains about 30% of the melatonin concentration in blood. 
											Using saliva instead of blood is better for the patients as it is non-invasive. Urine only contains metabolites of melatonin 
											and is not as accurate.  Furthermore, we learned about the process of measuring the melatonin levels. 
											Usually, Dr. Acuna takes six samples of saliva of one patient and uses five assays of ELISA. 
											It takes about one to two days from taking the samples to having the results. 
											The price for one sample measured with mass spectrometry is around 90-100€. With 5-6 samples per patient, 
											a melatonin measurement costs 600-800€ for only one patient.   

											Additionally, we asked Dr. Acuña about the correlation between melatonin and different diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. 
											He stated that for example, patients with Alzheimer’s disease have low levels of melatonin. 
											Melatonin can be used in those cases as a therapeutically drug. Dr. Acuña told us that there are different influences of melatonin on the course of the disease. 
											In the early stages of the loss of cognitive abilities, a dose of around 50-60 mg melatonin can help to stop the progression of it.  
											Besides, Dr. Acuña sees a desperate need for a more specific method. Except for mass spectrometry, 
											the current techniques are standard scientific methods but have a lack of sensitivity. 
											He believes that a device which is placed directly in the doctor’s office would redefine melatonin measurement. 
											Finally, we asked him about the future of melatonin measurement. He stated that society is gaining more awareness of the importance of melatonin. 
											It is entering the drug market and is used more often for patients. Therefore, he demands a better measurement method.  
											Our talk with Prof. Dr. Acuña had a deep impact on our project. After the interview, 
											we decided to measure the melatonin level in saliva as it is more accurate than urine and non-invasive compared to blood. 
											Furthermore, we decided to engineer a point-of-care-diagnostic to speed up the measurement process. 
											This was the very beginning of our hardware project.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Introduction to the SPR method for a cell-free biosensor," 
											After talking to Dr. Acuna, we realized that a cell-free solution would be even better for a point-of-care-diagnostic device. 
											Therefore, we met with Prof. Dr. Wiechert, who is an expert on hardware solution. 
											He introduced us to the analysis technique SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance). 
											During our research, we concluded that LSPR (Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance) is even more suitable for our hardware device. 
											To learn more about this technique, please look at the hardware page. 
											Prof. Dr. Wiechert explained that only a few companies use LSPR and that their products are expensive 
											(about 200,000€ to 300,000€). 
											Furthermore, we discussed other approaches like the Molecular Beacon Method. 
											But he advised us not to use it due to its complexity. 
											Besides, he introduced us to Prof. Bott who helped us in the next step. 
"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Choosing RZR as a receptor for our hardware device,"
											After getting the SPR idea from Professor Wiechert we visited Professor Michael Bott in the Juelich Reasearch Center, 
											who leads the systemic microbiology there. He told us more about this technology and we discussed with him different 
											melatonin receptors to use. We learned that working with the MT1 receptor should be avoided because it is a membranous protein. 
											So for anchoring it, we would need to create an artificial membrane, which would be a tricky task. 
											Professor Bott suggested using preferably our other melatonin receptor, the transcription factor RZR.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Semiconductor Experts,"
											In August we started looking for partners to build our gold nanostructure. 
											We had a lot of luck to talk with experts in this field from the Institute for Semiconductors (IHT) 
											and the Institute of Integrated Photonics (IPH): Dr. Florian Merget of the IPH and Stefan Scholz of the IHT. 
											We met multiple times to talk about our concept.
											At first, our hardware idea was to build an optic fiber based LSPR System. 
											In this setup, the gold nano structure is placed on top of a small optic fiber and the light is guided 
											from the lamp to the nano structure by the glass fiber. Some light is reflected back by Plasmon Resonance, 
											guided through the fiber and then analyzed in the spectrometer. The advantage is that the optical handling and alignment is really easy. 
											No moving parts and lenses that need to be in focus are needed. 
											That is why we at first preffered this method.
											After presenting this idea, we got to talk about how commercial chips like those inside a computer, 
											smartphone or car are produced. Dr. Merget and Mr. Scholz had a lot of insight to this. 
											They explained that in principle it would be possible to structure Au nanoparticles on top of a small 0.14 mm 
											fiber with experimental electron-beam processing (e-beam). But this would prohibit using normal 
											commercial litography systems like UV-litography which are state of the art right now. 

											All commercial litography systems are optimized to work with thin wafers. 
											The space inside these machines prohibits placing long fibers in them. 
											The vast share of the cost of producing nano structures lies in the price of the machines. 
											If standard semiconductor machines are used like UV-litography, 
											then the price per chip in mass production can be cut to a couple of dollars.
											During the discussion, we changed our setup from placing the Au nano structure on top of the fiber to placing 
											it on standard glass wafers. This greatly reduces the cost of the wafer and markets the wafer as a disposable part, 
											that you change once you want to measure a different molecule.
											
											In another meeting, Mr. Scholz also gave us a tour of their clean room and machines. 
											It is really impressive what kind of effort goes into making those small nano structures. 
											Just the machines for clean non-ionized water are as big as two student dorms.
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Hardware Optimization: From Reflection to Transmission,"We met with Dr. Mourran, group leader for Thermoplasmonics of Nanoparticles at the DWI Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials. 
											His group uses Plasmon Resonance to liquify hydrogels. 
											He is an expert in the application of Plasmon Resonance and the different setups available. 
											With his input we changed our approach from reflection to transmission.
											The reason we approached him, was to talk about a possible partnership to manufacture the Au nano particles. 
											He was quite intrigued, but could not help us with the manufacturing, as they did not have the necessary machinery. 
											But he could lend us his expertise. Firstly, he taught us a lot about the actual physics, what Plasmon Resonance is and how they use it. 
											With his applied knowledge in using Plasmons for thermal purposes, we learned how all the different parameters influence Plasmon Resonance. 
											Secondly, during intense discussion we further evolved our setup. Up until that point, 
											we wanted to analyze the reflected light with the spectrometer. 
											This light is scattered by Plasmon Resonance in a 90° angle from the wafer. 
											It is a clear signal, but it is very weak. Furthermore, this means that the incident light beam, 
											that excites the Plasmons, and the reflected light beam are running inverse parallel. Because of this, 
											a beam splitter is needed. As our spectrometer is not extremely sensitive, Dr. Mourran advised that we should consider a transmission setup. 
											We followed his advice as this also simplified the setup. The beam splitter is not needed in this case, and this results in one component less that needs to be perfectly adjusted. 
											"
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Searching for Fano Resonance through Simulation,"Dr. Mouran recommended us to talk to another expert in this field, 
											who could give us some quantifiable data at which wavelength the Plasmon Resonance occurs. 
											He put us in contact with Dr. Chigrin, group leader for Theory of complex materials at the DWI Leibniz Institute for 
											Interactive Materials. 
											After a few minutes into the presentation of our proposed nanogold structure layout, 
											Dr. Chigrin immediately started talking about how we could develop such a sensor without running simulations first. 
											We were a bit confused as plasmon resonance occurs in nanoparticles always, the resonance wavelength changes depending on size and shape. 
											Then we realized that we were talking about two different phenomena. 
											Dr. Chigrin thought that we wanted to use the phenomena of Fano resonance in our sensor, 
											because we had a periodic hexagon grid of discs with 160 nm diameter and 400 nm distance from each other. 
											We had never heard about this and were curious. Fano resonance is an interference phenomenon. 
											It occurs if the plasmon resonance wavelength meets the Bragg condition. This could greatly enhance the peak of our signal (figure 1).
											The zone in which the Bragg condition is met, is quite small and dependent on a lot of factors. A college of Dr. Chigrin, Sebastian Meyer, did a simulation search for the distances where the bragg condition is met. You can read more about Fano resonance and the simulation results, that Sebastian Meyer did, in our wiki. "
Aachen,Human Practices Gold/Silver,Suggestions for further improvements," Taking all the feedback into account, our project does not have to end just yet. 
											We could engineer some improvements to our technique to make it market-ready. 
											Before we can sell our product to doctor’s offices, we must make some adjustments to the device itself 
											as well as to the production process. Presumably, we will provide only a few practices with our hardware at first to 
											get feedback from users before launching our product. Afterwards, 
											we will be able to write an user-friendly software for the most pleasant user-experience. 
											It should be as easy to handle as possible to ensure the frequently use of Melasense.
											Furthermore, our technique is applicable to more hormones, for example estrogen and cholesterol. 
											We could engineer a multi-hormone measurement method as a point-of-care-diagnostic to not only redefine melatonin measurement, 
											but also the measurement of a bunch of similar hormones. 
											In the future, the measurement of those hormones could be integrated in the regular health check to raise awareness 
											of the importance of hormone balance. 
											As our final goal, we want to engineer a bracelet with an implemented chip which could measure the melatonin level 
											of patients overnight multiple times to quantify the results and to take point-of-care-diagnostic to the next level.

Aachen,Public Engagement,Discussing the Science behind Synthetic Biology," 
						
						As most people do not know, melatonin plays a significant role in both physical and psychological diseases. During the last couple of months, we presented our project at several occasions. 
						We talked with young students who participated in the “Jugend forscht” competition. Furthermore, we organized a project at a school, giving the students the opportunity to experience the life of a scientist. In Addition, we were at a radio station to reach out to more people. 
						Above all, we interviewed the European and Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board to understand how we could make actual change. Enlighten the public is the most important act in changing the currently existing strict law for melatonin medication in the EU.  
						By doing so, we hoped to get people to recognize the importance of melatonin and raise awareness of sciences.

ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Silver,"Hangzhou is widely known by water- related UNESCO World Heritages – West Lake and Grand Canal, however, severe water pollution has been received more and more attention in recent years. Another environmental pollution problem that is as important as water is soil pollution, especially heavy metal pollution. Hence, we want to design a operability device to solve the above environmental problems. After a series of brainstorming as well as literature research, the project direction was becoming clear. Our topic inspired by a paper published in Science, March 2018 [1]. It mainly talked about the gene expression of methanobactine which is originated from methanotrophy, which triggers us the idea of using this gene to eliminate the heavy metal (copper) pollution in surrounding environment. In order to confirm the project direction, we launched the human practice research carefully. The research included 3 parts: general background investigation, public survey, field trip and professional interview; the research objective focused on two aspects:1) Whether the heavy metal pollution problem, especially copper, is very important to environment and public health.2) Whether synthetic biology method could be accepted."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,General Background Investigation,"Heavy metal pollution refers to the environmental pollution caused by heavy metals and their compounds. Although some heavy metals are essential trace elements, most of them can be toxic to all forms of life at high concentrations due to formation of complex compounds within the cell. Unlike organic pollutants, heavy metals once introduced into the environment cannot be biodegraded. They persist indefinitely and cause pollution of air, water, and soils. Thus, the main strategies of pollution control are to reduce the bioavailability, mobility, and toxicity of metals. Methods for remediation of heavy metal-contaminated environments include physical removal, detoxification, bioleaching, and phytoremediation[2][3].Heavy metal pollution is a worldwide challenge, recently, because of industrialization, heavy metal pollution has become a serious problem in China[4]. There were lots of heavy metal pollution accidents have been reported frequently[5]. Moreover, according to Investigation report on nationwide soil pollution 2014, the soil heavy metal pollution points rate has been 16.1%, especially in mining area and populated areas. Copper is one of important heavy metal, and copper pollution has been a serious problem in Guangdong province and Hebei province, especially in Baoding, the copper content in soil is 165 times higher than national standard[6].[1] Kenney et al., Science 359, 1411–1416 (2018)[2] Heavy Metal Pollution: Source, Impact, and Remedies, Mohammed A.S., Kapri A., Goel R.

[6] Duan Q., Lee J., Liu Y., Chen H., Hu H., (2016) Distribution of Heavy Metal Pollution in Surface Soil Samples in China: A Graphical Review. Bull Environ Contam Toxicol. Jun 24."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Public Survey,"In order to understand the public’s opinion of our project, we first carried out a marketing research with 1000 pieces of surveys handed out. Overall, there is considerably high expectation over our copper-binding product but relatively low awareness over the synthetic biology. More detailed analysis would be displayed for the following."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,The impact of heavy metal pollution on the general public’s life,"For the survey, including 1067 recycling questionnaires from16 different regions, we have enough sources to reveal how statistically those heavy metal pollutions jeopardize our environment and economics. According to the results of questionnaires, we found that the impact of heavy metal pollution is impalpable by a large group of people, even people living near industrial districts (Figure 1 and Table 1).Table 1 and Figure 1However, when the question focus on “food safety induced by soil pollution”, it is astonishing that with more than half of the informants are “very anxious” towards the issue of food safety (Figure 2) (85.5% of the informants are either very serious or serious about the food safety issue), unlike our expectation which their life will also be largely affected by “soil pollution”, they are way less serious about that issue.Figure 2It could be reasonably argued that people are more attentive towards the food problem that is directly relative to the health problem than soil pollution problem which is more distant. But generally, they are concern about soil pollution by heavy metal as a whole. And thanks to the issue and their concerns, the outlook of our project seams bright."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Concerns (expectation) over the biological products,"However, as a new form of purging product, the biological method to decompose soil pollution will probably be resisted by consumers. Based on our research, we could conclude several reasons why the consumers would have negative attitude to ameliorate polluted soil by biological methods.The imparted micro-organisms may be unmanageable.As shown in Figure 3, about 26.3% informants fear that those micro-organisms would remain in the soil (or water) and then be indirectly brought into our human body, causing unpredictable disease.Figure 3Even if the product does ameliorate the soil, people fear that there are insalubrious micro-organisms remaining in the soil, leading to further new pollution (Figure 4).Figure 4"
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Field Trip and Professional Interviews,"From our initial idea to a clear research plan, in order to have a picture on design of our working parts and our prototype to the future applications of our project, the opinions of specialists have been vital in influencing our work. In one hand, we took two field trips to the sewage treatment plants, one is treating domestic sewage and the other is treating industrial wastewater; in the other hand, we went to College of Environmental and Resource Science of Zhejiang University and interviewed two professors, and a visiting professor from MIT."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Field Trip to Local Urban Sewage Plant,"Four team members including wet team leader Rongjian Tang visited Hangzhou West sewage treatment plant, to learn the modern treating methods of sewage by bacteria. This urban sewage treatment plant uses bacteria to process the sewage from west of Hangzhou, which gives us inspiration in designing our own processor for our product. For example, when designing our prototype, we extra added the use of germicidal lamp and the settling basin to eliminate the public fear of bioengineering methods. Moreover, we learned from the engineer that the domestic sewage treatment plant had no capacity to treat any heavy metal wastewater, however they were responsible to monitor these values, from his point of view, heavy metal detection devices should have broad market."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Field Trip to Industrial Sewage Plant,"Justin Yan, the dry team leader, visited Baoding Baoyun Plate Making Co.Ltd located in Baoding, Hebei, China. This company mainly focused on producing intaglio roller for printing. During the manufacturing process, copper is needed to polish the surface of the metal. So industrial waste water is produced during the process. The original copper inside the water before filtering is 5-184mg/L. Currently, the sewage treatment system is composed of 7 different units: neutralization, settlement, sand leach, carbon-filtrating, resin exchange, ultrafiltration, and antiosmosis. After the process in the system, the waste water could have a copper level lower than 0.15mg/L. Although the process meets the government’s requirement, it takes to much space and the electrical usage is huge. The cost is high, and the working environment is unpleasant."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Interview to Prof. Ruo He,"Professor of Environmental Science department of Zhejiang UniversityOur initial plan was to clone the Mbns gene from the methanotrophs. However upon sequencing the amplified inserts, none of the sequences were what we expected to find. And we have learned the methanobactine's mechanism inside methanotroph but is not yet fully understood.We asked Prof. Ruo He, an expert who mainly worked on methanotrophs, for advice. She told us as an anaerobic bacteria, methanotrophs are really hard to operate in normal conditions. So finding the corresponding sequence and synthesizing it and then transferring the Mbns gene into E.coli would be more efficient and helpful. Combined with the results of survey mentioned above, we chose Escherichia coli BL21 strain which is low toxicity and low sensitivity to human and environment. And we also successfully constructed the new basic part MbnABC which is submitted to Registry (BBa_2826000). "
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Interview to Prof. Jiyan Shi,"Professor, Chair of Environmental engineering department of Zhejiang UniversityInitially, we have a big plan about using biological methods to copper treatment basing on Mbn, but we were lack of recognition of exsiting sewage treatment methods. We consulted prof. Jiyan Shi, as one of the top researchers in the field of sewage treatment, for advice. He listed the ways heavy metal polluted waters could be treated, which are very efficient and environmental friendly already. However, the regular testing of water quality is not as easy as treating them. Especially for those poor villages in the middle of nowhere. They don't have good access to the testing equipment, and they are among the group of people with lest health care in the nation. So we adjusted our design of proposal, changing from Methanibactine synthesis and real-world application to find a more accessible way to moniter copper pollution (by naked eyes)."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Interview to Dr Timothy Guanda Lu,"Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering MIT During the time section of experimenting at Zhejiang University, we are lucky enough to listen to the report of Dr. Lu, a professor from MIT who has extensive experience in the field of synthetic biology, about genetic engineering. We also have asked him for the opinion about our project, such as how does he see the suicide system we designed in our project. Dr. Lu first affirmed our thoughts and pointed out that the design of synthetic biological components must meet the actual needs. Based on his useful advice, we have further improved our project plan, including biosafety of placing the engineered bacteria into environment, further improved the parts design to more closer to actual needs, etc."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Conclusion,"1. Heavy metal pollution is a serious problem especially in China because of the industrialization;2. Copper is an important heavy metal which may result water and soil pollution;3. Heavy metal (copper) detection and treatment are very important, and biological method based on synthetic biology could be a good solution;4. General public lacked knowledge on heavy metal pollution but really concerned any potential health risk from pollution;5. General public lacked knowledge on synthetic biology and had concerns genetically biological products."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Gold Integrated,"To sum up, according to the research results mentioned above, we have improved the project from the following two aspects."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Public Science Activities,"we found the core issue of public concern is not the new method itself, but the unknown harm and actual effect that new method or things may bring. Against insufficient public understanding of synthetic biology and gene erringeering, our team organized four public science events at Hangzhou Low Carbon Science and Technology Museum (China), Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum as well as Zhejiang Museum of Natural History, Ningbo Foreign Language School.In AST Space activity, at least 6 iGEM teams participated in the provincial science and Technology Museum activity. We take children to play games which help them to touch base with the science like we led them to finish the extraction of artificial colors. We also give a speech on the stage to summary the project of each team and its contribution to society. Moreover, we brought out two education lectures about metal contamination and synthetic biology in the main hall of Zhejiang Natural Museum. For both lectures, around fifty audiences participate to the lecture. The first part of the lecture explained the destruction of metal contamination and how our product can solve it. The second disseminates the basics about synthetic biology and genome biology. Moreover, we set out an experiment for banana DNA extraction which helps to support the participants to understand. In Hangzhou Low Carbon Science & Technology Museum of China we educate the public on the benefits of a low carbon lifestyle and provides space for exhibitions relating to science and technology. ASTWS-China worked in conjunction with the Museum, as well as three other IGEM teams, on a public engagement event. Eventually, three events ended consummately and successfully."
ASTWS-China,Gold Integrated,Adjust our research project,"We adjust our research project and product design in several ways in response to public concerns and professional suggestions:1. Clarify the project direction step by step, from solving water pollution problem to heavy metal pollution, then copper pollution in water and soil;2. The strain selection of engineered microorganism and additional design of self-suicide parts for the final version product, so as to minimize the potential bio risks might bring to the natural environment.3. Proceed the project in two phases: phase one, copper pollutant detection; phase two, copper pollution and copper industrial wastewater treatment. Add copper detection parts as a very important component of the project.4. For application, design both a low-cost and easy-carry copper detection device as well as a low-cost and environmental friendly copper wastewater treatment system."
BGU Israel,Integrated Human Practices,The journey begins,"
One of our first steps when delving into this area of research was meeting with Efrat Carmi, CEO of IsrALS, who had inherited the position from Liat’s father. From this discussion we understood the gravity of this disease, how it decimates a person’s life in a rapid and irreversible way. How ALS research and awareness was, until recently, marginalized due to the rarity of the disease and the small size of the patients population. We heard about the challenges of finding a cure for a disease which is only 10% familial, leaving the other 90% of patients even further from a cure. From this  important meeting we drew a few conclusions crucial to the development of our project: that there is a need for a general approach which will cover the whole patients population and the significance of a therapy which would lengthen patient survival and quality of life, regardless of the origin of the disease. Throughout this conversation we also understood the sensitivity of the matter to the patients and their loved ones. The necessity in exploring and presenting our ideas in a way that does not give false hope. These core principles guided us throughout our research and when delivering our message to ALS patients and the general public.
"
BGU Israel,Integrated Human Practices,A therapy to all ALS cases,"
Next step was to thoroughly review available scientific information. Along with an in-depth review of the of the scientific literature we met with Dr. Adrian Israelson, PI of an ALS lab at Ben-Gurion university. Adrian described the budding interest in focusing on glial cells in ALS research. He has also described the unsuccessful attempts made to return the reactive Astrocytes to their healthy form. We identified that a focus on the microglia cells as relevant to our desire to develop a therapy applicable to all ALS cases, familial and sporadic alike! "
BGU Israel,Integrated Human Practices,"if it ain’t broke, improve it!
","
At this point we focused our interest on the Microglia and Astrocyte cells. Through our reading we identified the NFkB pathway as a target for cytokine knockdown in Microglia. However, we still needed to figure out how to tackle the reactive Astrocytes. As currently there is no way to reverse reactive astrocytes state to their resting state. The only viable option seemed to be to kill the  reactive astrocyte cells. With this idea in mind, we were reminded of the 2015 BGU-iGEM project, Boomerang.

This team used a double-plasmid system delivered by viruses in order to specifically target and kill cancer cells. The system answered many of our needs. It provided specificity by splitting the CasperCas9 enzyme and the gRNA components onto two different plasmids. We gave this plan an extra boost by choosing viruses which specifically infect only our target cells. At this point we had a concrete work plan! However, we still had reservations about approaching brain cells like cancer cells, unwanted cells we wish to kill. On top of this, we were concerned about suggesting the use of viruses in a therapy for humans.
"
BGU Israel,Integrated Human Practices,"justifying the risk
","
Luckily, we met with Dr. Perry Nisen, a member of the Board of Directors of Teva Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Nisen is an expert in neurodegenerative disease and a leader in the pharmaceutical industry. We presented our hypothesis and research plan to Dr. Nisen and then discussed our misgivings. An in-depth discussion regarding ethical dilemmas concerning genetic engineering, virus delivery, and the risk in killing central nervous system (CNS) cells led us to the following conclusions: Although genetic engineering is currently controversial, iGEM and Synthetic Biology aim to harness this technology for human advancements. Exploring these methods is the only way to make them safe and viable. We concluded that currently virus delivery is not ideal or accepted for drug delivery, however in the research phase it will give us a better chance of reaching proof of concept. Finally, although killing CNS cells may sound drastic, ALS is a fatal, aggressive disease. The benefits must be weighed against the risks. We believe that prolonging ALS patients’ survival indeed justifies this risk."
BGU Israel,Integrated Human Practices,For and with the ALS community,"
From this point we were ready to enter the lab phase of our project. In addition, we began planning our human practice activities. As we were aware of how sensitive it may be to present preliminary research to ALS patients and their families, we decided against presenting our project to this community. Rather, we would show our support through volunteering and participating in the annual isrALS fundraising race. Still we felt strongly about promoting awareness about ALS and Synthetic Biology. We realized that science, specifically synthetic biology projects, can only be implemented efficiently if there is a public support. Therefore, the first step is to promote awareness and understanding of such a project. This is why we hosted “iGEM on the Bar”. We invited our peers, colleagues, and the public to an evening at a local pub, with a small entrance fee, where we presented our project and invited our guests to donate or join the annual ALS race. All proceeds from this event were donated to the ALS community. 
"
BGU Israel,Integrated Human Practices,embraced by the scientific community,"
As we mentioned previously, the community of ALS research labs in Israel was very limited until recently. Still, as this is a small country, the budding community is still rather small, yet impressive. We were touched by how this community embraced us when we began our project. Any lab we talked to was more than happy to help point us in the right direction, teach us new tools, or provide access to equipment. We were compelled to do something in return, so we organized the annual ALS Research Conference at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (our University). The conference was a great success! Not only did we hear from the leading experts in ALS research, we were able to present our project for the first time in a scientific setting. Our presentation received encouraging responses. The community seemed truly excited by our idea and the questions we received were not about the viability of the idea, rather they were insightful thoughts regarding research methods. Many researchers offered their inputs and assistance to aid us in proceeding with our project. One of these researchers, was Dr. Dinorah Friedmann-Morvinski‏ from Tel-Aviv University. 
"
BGU Israel,Integrated Human Practices,achieving a proof of concept,"
Around the time of convention, we faced a major lab roadblock. We were having trouble infecting our cells with the plasmids we had designed, due to their size and the sensitivity of the CNS cell lines. Without the ability to insert our plasmids, we had no way of implementing our system. This is when Dr. Friedmann stepped in. Dr. Friedmann heard about our struggles and offered a project-saving solution. Her research group works with plasmids which implement knockdown of genes in the NFkB pathway and delivers these plasmids with viruses. Dr. Friedman was instrumental in teaching us infection techniques and providing us with plasmids from her lab. This collaboration meant, that even if we did not succeed in implementing our designed plasmids before the competition, we would still be able to achieve a proof of concept."
BGU Israel,Integrated Human Practices,Meeting the next generation of scientists,"
Our project would not have succeeded without our Human Practices. Our goals and implementation were all a result of involvement in the communities around us and sharing our ideas through discussions with experts. Science cannot proceed unaided and cannot succeed without public support. As a final gesture, we were delighted to host a group of high-school students in our lab. We had a great time explaining to them about iGEM, our project, and our lab. Although we ourselves as undergraduate students are only at the beginning of our scientific careers, it was wonderful to transfer the knowledge we have gathered to a new generation."

BGU Israel,Public Engagement,Friends4ALS 7th Annual Fundraising Race,"
On Thursday July 6, 2018 the OriginALS team participated in the “Annual Race for ALS
Patients”. All donations collected went directly towards promoting ALS research and supporting
ALS patients and their families.

Leading up to the race, the OriginALS team dedicated itself to fundraising for this great
cause. Each team member asked family and friends to sponsor them in the race. Additionally,
we embarked on a social media and a poster campaign around the university to recruit both
donations and additional race participants. We followed this up with a sign-up booth located in
the student union building, in which we took shifts for several days personally approaching
students and encouraging them to donate and join the race.

During this event we had the opportunity to meet ALS patients and talk with their
families, hearing how they confront the disease on a day to day basis. The event was very
meaningful for our team, as we met the people who we would potentially be helping, giving us
motivation to move forward with our project."

this event, our team gave a presentation about iGEM, the OriginALS project, and the upcoming
annual ALS fundraising race."
BGU Israel,Public Engagement,A Meeting with Tzvika Levi,"
At the ALS race closing ceremony, several patients shared their experiences with the disease. One of the patients who spoke was Tzvika Levi. Tzvika is known in Israel as the “father of the lone soldiers” due to his tireless support of and advocation for lone soldiers. Lone soldiers are soldiers whose families are not in the country or are not able to care for them during the child’s mandatory army service in the Israel Defense Forces. Tzvika recently won the president’s award for outstanding Israeli citizens due to this work.

Avital Bailen, an iGEM team member, has known Tvika since she was a lone soldier herself. At the onset of the OriginALS project, Avital visited Tzvika and his corageuous wife Naomi, and wrote the following about that experience:
I first met Tzvika when I was eighteen years old, freshly out of high-school and a few months after making Aliya to Israel. By that time, Tzvika was already a legend to lone soldiers. We had heard countless stories about Tzvika “saving the day” when there was nobody else to turn to; helping people get into the army units they were interested in, connecting them to adopted families, or just checking up on them to say hi. I didn’t know it at the time, but I too would make a phone call one day to Tzvika when I was in need. 

I had served in a co-ed infantry combat unit for almost 3 years and was looking forward to my discharge vacation, a few weeks of paid vacation given to combat soldiers as a token of appreciation for their service. I was having some difficulty with my Brigade Commander, a very high-ranking officer, who insisted on revoking my discharge vacation. Frustrated by the situation, I decided to try and contact Tzvika to see if he could help. 
"
BGU Israel,Public Engagement,Youth Science-Workshop Visit,"On Thursday, August 2, 2018 a group of twenty students from the Choosidman Youth
Science Center visited our lab. This high-achieving group of high-school students participated in
a two-week Science workshop during their summer vacation.
As part of this workshop, they visited our lab and were taught about iGEM and the OriginALS project. After the introduction, we gave the students a tour of the lab and explained some of the processes we use in order to implement our ideas, such as plasmid cloning methods and how cell-lines are maintained. The students were especially excited to learn about the high-school iGEM track.
We encouraged them to investigate the option of putting together an iGEM team at their local schools. It was a
pleasure to host these talented students who had excellent and insightful questions!"
BGU Israel,Public Engagement,Local News,"OriginALS team member, Nitzan Keidar, submitted a post to iBGU: Innovation, Science, and Technology Blog, where she discusses how the 2018 iGEM-BGU team began its journey.OriginALS team member, Liat Tsoran, was invited to a local morning show “Morning Health,” where she discussed her father’s battle with ALS and the OriginALS project.OriginALS team member, Liat Tsoran, was interviewed for the national newspaper Ynet, where she discussed the inspiration for the OriginALS project."
BGU Israel,Public Engagement,OriginALS Animation,"As part of our goal to make the OriginALS idea accessible to the public, we created a
short animation video which provides a visual aid to understanding the scientific aspects of the
project.
We tried to be very precise with our video message and invested a great deal of effort in
order to get people excited about this idea, yet avoid spreading false hopes to ALS patients and
their families.
We hope you enjoy and learn something new!

BJRS China,Human Practices,Overview,"      Our goal is to increase the oxygen carrying capacity of engineering bacteria. We expect to increase the yield of engineered bacteria. If realized, the development of fermentation industry can be promoted. In order to get more information about our project and guide our project, we went to Bluepha to do research and interview.
We also hope that by participating in the iGEM competition, we can have an impact on our community and the people around us. So we launched a questionnaire in the name of BJRS, and through the promotion of BJRS public name, to investigate public attitudes and understanding of genetically modified foods. A total of 675 feedbacks were received, ranging from under 12 to over 65, covering a wide range of educational qualifications and jobs. The results show that the public's understanding of GM is still inadequate, and the phenomenon of blind resistance is serious. So we carried out a lecture on Synthetic biology in Beijing Jianhua Experimental School."
BJRS China,Human Practices, Integrated Human Practices,"      Bluepha is a bio fermentation company. Its main products are bio plastics. In the company, we practically experienced biological plastic products, and learned the fermentation tank and fermentation process, also, interviewed the employees. The following is the interview record."
BJRS China,Human Practices,Here Are Some Q&As  ,"    Q: What is the most pressing issue in fermetation process？    A: The biggest issue is disinfection, which acounts for almost half of the excutive costs in most circumstances. Contamination of other bacteria lead to waste and disposal of entire fernetautib cylinder.    Q: What are the other pressing issues?    A: Yield of engineered strain and downstream processing.    Q: What is the current way of oxygen supply?    A: Currently we bubble sterilised air to the cylinder and use blades to stir for homogenous distribution of air.    Q: Have you ever think of other ways to increase oxygen capacity?    A: Not as I know it. The oxygen solubility in water gives a upper limit for oxygen capacity.    Q: What is the current fermetation rate?    A: It usually takes two to three days for a typical cylinder to finish fermetation. The downstream processes cost at least another two to three days.    Q: What factors affect the process?    A: The main factor is the nature of the engineered strain we chosen. Other factors include the product we desire, and the medium we use.    Q: How to select engineered strains in Bluepha?    A: Currently, we use a holamonas strain which survives in high salt level. This potentially prevents from contamination of other bacerium as they are not able to grow in such an extreme condition."
BJRS China,Human Practices,"  After on-the-spot visits and data consulting, the members of the group concluded that there were two main indicators for the evaluation of fermentation effect.","  1. fermentation rate / fermentation cycle of bacteria      The fermentation of bacteria can be roughly divided into two processes. According to our understanding of fermentation process, the total cycle is about 48-72 hours. The first part is the growth period of bacteria, which lasts about 24-36 hours. When the bacteria grow to the plateau stage (i.e. no nutrient supply is needed for growth and development), it enters the second stage, that is, the production of the target product stage, which lasts about 24-56 hours, the production capacity of bacteria reaches the limit.      The fermentation rate of bacteria is mainly affected by dissolved oxygen. In the process of fermentation, the content of dissolved oxygen is restricted by two factors.    （1） Type of tank and fan blade      Different fermentation tanks and fan blades will affect the contact degree and mixing uniformity of bacteria with various nutrients and oxygen, and then affect the growth and production efficiency of bacteria. Therefore, suitable fermentor should be selected during fermentation.    （2） pH value      In the process of bacterial growth, respiration will produce lactic acid and other organic acids, resulting in less and less pH in the tank, fermentation efficiency gradually reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the pH value every half hour in the fermentation process to ensure that the fermentation efficiency does not decrease.  2. pour rate / recovery rate      After fermentation, the material in the tank needs to be recovered. Not all fermenters can produce a large number of target products, some even can not get the target products. Therefore, in this case, the concept of ""pouring rate"" has emerged, that is, the number of successful tanks as a proportion of the total number of tanks. This indicator is affected by two factors.    （1）improper disinfection      before fermentation, the fermentor must be sterilized once. If the disinfection is not complete, the mixed bacteria will be mixed into the tank and grow with the target strain. Some of the more viable strains will grab nutrients and oxygen, resulting in a serious decline in the survival and dry weight of the target strains.    （2） pH value       If pH value is not suitable for the growth of the target bacteria, it will also lead to a very small amount of bacteria, the rate of tank pouring is low."
BJRS China,Public Engagement,WeChat subscription,"      We established a WeChat subscription, launching introductions, questionnaires, and declaring feedbacks."
BJRS China,Public Engagement,Report on Questionnaire ,"     To investigate public’s cognition state and acceptance level on genetically modiﬁed food(referred as GM food in parts of the article below), we set up this questionnaire. It includes twenty questions, of which consist the sample's age, occupation and educational background, as well as a series of surveys on genetically modiﬁed food. A total of 675 questionnaires were collected in this survey.         The following questions are not in exactly the same order as those in the questionnaire, but are rather sorted by relevancy.1. Basic information statistics         Question 1: age statistics          Question 2: occupation statistics         Question 3: educational background statistics     From these charts, we could see that our responders are distributed in various ages, industries and educational backgrounds, and the sample size is relatively large, reaching 675 people. Therefore, this survey has certain universality and representativeness.          Question 4: the most common way to acquire knowledge/information
      The purpose of question 4 is to investigate the ways the public obtain information. It can be seen from the ﬁgure above that people mainly obtain information through search engines, WeChat subscriptions and other network methods. In order to reach a more eﬀective and eﬃcient way to spread information, these ways are our best choice list. 
2. Public awareness and opinions on genetically modiﬁed food       Question 5: Will you pay attention to the topic of ""safety of genetically modiﬁed food”?
      The results showed that 243 people were generally concerned. 236 people were more concerned. Ninety-eight were very concerned and 83 were less concerned; Fifteen people don't pay any attention.          Question 6: Whether or not it is considered appropriate to label food packaging as genetically modiﬁed food?
       We could see that almost everyone states that they had the rights to know what their food consist of, and only about thirty person do not care about this topic.        From our data related to the two questions, we could reach the conclusion that most people are actually concerned about the safety of genetically modiﬁed food, and they care about whether their food have been genetically modiﬁed, which makes our research and future movements more meaningful. And we could assume that this is a hot topic, and we could raise public’s attention if we engage with them via this theme.       To get more detailed information on public opinion and awareness, we added a few more questions.       Question 7: Among theses statements, which best ﬁts your understanding of genetically modiﬁed food?
       From our ﬁgures above, we could see that most people have fair awareness and their own proper thinking towards genetically modiﬁed food, whether it is negative or positive, at least they are aware of the principle/basic theory of genetically modiﬁed food and the process before they appear on the market. But still, about thirteen percent of people thought GM food might as well change our genes and cause us to transform into alternative creatures, which means they need more detailed information on this technology.        If you put another question in mind and consider the two questions together, things become fairly interesting.      Question 8: In your consideration, what drawbacks does genetically modiﬁed food have?
       In all responses, number of people thinking that GM food could increase incidence of various diseases comes ﬁrst. Since this is actually a fairly possible hypothesis that we are all concerned about, we were really glad to see this result. But people thinking it might be harmful to our genes comes second. Although it is not an impossible hypothesis, it contradicts the results from the previous question, in which only a small percent of person chose""They modiﬁed genes of food, and might produce some unknown poisonous matters”. This leads us to assume that there is a number of people who do not really understand what gene engineering is, so they see harm our genes” and “cause variations” as two diﬀerent options, proving that we need more education about this.        To form a complete set, we also set up a question discussing advantages of GM food.         Question 9: In your consideration, what advantages does genetically modiﬁed food have?
      And we had another similar questions, which we could consider together.

        Question 10: In your consideration, Why is there such a thing as genetically modiﬁed food?
"
BJRS China,Public Engagement,Feedback on school presentations,"      Through our questionnaire feedback, we found that the public still had some misunderstandings about synthetic biology and genetically modified methods, so we decided to conduct a school lecture. The original idea was to popularize the basic knowledge of synthetic biology through this lecture, and contribute to the popularization of synthetic biology and the transformation of public opinion.        Our instructor and three teams mates lectured on different subjects, which mainly includes three topics. First on all, is THEORY, which is the basic knowledge on molecular and synthetic biology, along with some interesting and controversial news and problems in the field that is meaningful to be discussed. Secondly, is PRACTICE, which stands for the methods we used in our experiments and the significance behind them. Last, is COMPETITION, representing a introduction on iGEM and our team project, hoping to raise the public’s attention and interests in participating in synthetic biology and being an experimenter themselves.
      Since recycling the public’s ideas can broaden our own thinking, therefore preventing us from getting stuck in a situation where a lot of energy is invested in a certain direction, but the general trend of the whole discipline is ignored. In this case, we should take the current situation of development and popularization into account and make corresponding changes and efforts. Thus we collected the feedbacks and analyzed them respectfully. 
"
BJRS China,Public Engagement,About the harvest,"   In the feedback we collected, 25% of those who had a lot of harvest, 39% of those who had a certain harvest, 22% of those who had some harvest, 10% of those who had a little harvest, and 4% of those who had no harvest. The presentation involves students and teachers of all grades and levels in the school, so the difficulty of the presentation is a key issue. More people are concentrated in the area where there is harvest, which indicates that the difficulty and difficulty of our publicity is more appropriate, which basically reaches our original intention of popularizing popular science."
BJRS China,Public Engagement,About the idea,"   The audience's thoughts on the application field are concentrated in the related fields of medicine, biology, pharmacy and so on, which is also what the scientists are aiming at. There have been some successful applications in medicine, such as the synthesis of artemisinin and the precursor of the anticancer drug Paclitaxel. Synthetic biology is also closely related to sociology and social production, although the public is less involved, and there are already studies and partial production of bioenergy and biological products. In general, the field of synthetic biology development is more in line with public expectations.      ;In fact, philosophy is a very broad subject. Specific science is the foundation of philosophy. The progress of specific science promotes the development of philosophy. The specific science that we are doing is important for philosophy, but it is not limited to the field of synthetic biology.      The answer to the field of synthetic biology is more diverse, broadly grouped into health care, academic research, industrial production, life and society. Academic research contains paleontology research, genetic modification, human cloning, biological weapons, etc., of course there are also many disputes, sometimes technical level can achieve, but the moral and ethical will limit its reality, so in the process of the application of synthetic biology, still have many difficulties to be overcome, is not only a technical, there are some social factors, involves many interdisciplinary areas. The idea of a health care orientation that treats cancer, produces organs, evolves immune systems, synthetic antibiotics and other drugs, as well as in-vitro fertilization, needs to be based on a lot of academic research and ethical discussion. The application of production has been mature, such as cell factories and other technologies. Obviously, industrial production is also closely related to the development of academic research. Life and society, for example, will contribute to the development of medical ethics. To sum up, the development of synthetic biology is more in line with the public expectation and faces some problems. People who study synthetic biology need to make efforts to bring it into public view, eliminate misunderstandings and provide more possible choices in the future.

Calgary,Integrated,University of Calgary Faculty Presentation,"In May 2018, our team held an informational presentation outlining our preliminary ideas and plans for researchers, doctors, and general interest groups at the University of Calgary. We presented a 10 minute pitch of our project, then opened the floor to questions, comments and criticisms from the experts in attendance. 
              Logistical comments were made regarding different transfection methods and whether to use wild type Cas9 or nickase.
              However, an unexpected yet repeated message from a few experts was to stray away from gene therapy and instead focus on using our toolkit for gene integration. 
              The argument specified that gene therapy is filled with unknowns and hurdles, both physical and ethical, and navigating this landscape would not be worth the effort when our system could be readily applied to any gene integration application within basic research. 
              The main champion of this viewpoint was Dr. Ian Lewis, a professor at the University of Calgary whom we proceeded to meet with down the road.
              The specifics of these meetings can be found lower down on this page. This presentation provided us with some tangible laboratory knowledge regarding ideal procedures and methods, however the more salient impact was the effect on our team direction. 
              This faculty session was the first time that we considered pivoting from gene therapy, and instead focusing on developing a gene integration toolkit for broader application in research.
 Perhaps the idea of switching gears for our project direction warranted some further investigation...
"
Calgary,Integrated,Safety and Ethical Considerations in Literature Review,"With the advice we received from our faculty presentation fresh in our minds, we consulted literature that discussed the safety and ethical considerations attached to gene therapy, CRISPR, and regulation of modified organisms. Even though we planned to make our system as safe as possible, it was important to examine the negative implications that our work could have and the difficulties we might face. Knowing that our project had applications beyond gene therapy and in research as a whole, we delved into related literature with a more critical eye for the pitfalls of a gene therapy-based project. 

Through examining present literature, we found out that issues of safety and bioethics are an ongoing discussion, and it is our scientific and moral responsibility to address these discussions due to the implications of our own project. Particularly, we thought it would be beneficial to engage individuals that have backgrounds internal and external to the realm of synthetic biology, whether that be within a laboratory or a public context. These meetings were used to verify preliminary research done on bioethical topics to determine if the surrounding community echoed the sentiment of present literature. In addition, our meetings would inform the framework with which we designed our project.
"
Calgary,Integrated,Meeting with Dr. Ian Lewis," Dr. Lewis works as a Chair for Alberta Innovates: Health Solutions in Translational Health in Metablomics, and is an assistant professor at the University of Calgary.
              His work centres on connecting metabolic adaptation and virulence of human pathogens, and developing new diagnostic methods and novel antimicrobial therapies. 
              As an interested party, he had attended our faculty presentation earlier in the summer and provided initial thoughts on our project. 
              He was worried about the difficulty of addressing a topic as large as gene therapy, and thought that the sheer amount of unknowns and barriers involved with such an endeavour would prove problematic.
              He counselled us to use our gene integration framework for generic research purposes. 
              Later, we met with Dr. Lewis again to talk about our progress and to identify potential applications for our work that might avoid the inherent safety dilemmas within gene therapy.
              He was particularly interested in our project's applicability as a molecular modification tool, due to its wide usability in several fields of work. 
              He thought the project could be used in molecular biology and gene analysis because it pertains to functions in metabolic disorders (his specialty) in a eukaryotic, human context.
              Particularly in his lab, work being done on DCMA syndrome (a metabolic disorder) could be advanced with the use of a tool that allows for the knock-in of genes to characterize their function in the syndrome. 
              In a general context he described the potential of Snip, Equip, Flip as an “anvil”, whereas current technology such as CRISPR, could be likened to that of a “sword”. 
              Emphasis put on our project’s utility as a tool for understanding biology further justified a shift toward expanding the scope of our project to become a toolkit for researchers, as opposed to strictly being a gene therapy system."
Calgary,Integrated,Meeting with Dr. Walter Glannon," The team met with Dr. Walter Glannon, a professor of philosophy at the University of Calgary, to discuss ethical considerations related to our project. 
              Dr. Glannon, who specializes in bioethics, provided a unique perspective to the work we performed over the summer. By sticking within the realm of research, he informed us that 
              ethicists would not see many ethical questions as being necessarily relevant.  From Dr. Glannon's perspective, while operating within a research context, the use of CRISPR is not constrained. On the contrary, its use as a tool for “knock-outs” (genetic deletions) within a more clinical context raises red flags with ethicists. Gene therapy has struggled to become a widely trusted treatment or cure for genetic diseases, due to past failures, and there are extensive regulations on its use. However, within a conceptual framework, no ethical issues are raised. 
              Dr. Glannon also encouraged us to look into the source of the cells we worked on for this project. From further investigation, we were able to determine that the HEK293T cells came from a cell line maintained since 1973 from a legally aborted fetus. From Dr. Glannon’s perspective, this is legally, and thus ethically, acceptable, assuming the fetus does not have moral status. This meeting helped us validate that we fully investigated all related ethical considerations within the context of our project. Dr. Glannon also directed us to a discussion paper on the Canada SynBio 2018 Conference that revealed a desire for more transparency in work done within the rapidly evolving field of synthetic biology. This need for openness stems from the reality that society does not always understand research, and therefore fear the unknown. Furthermore, he mentioned the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, which echoed ideas of transparency with the public, going so far as aiming to implement education programs for the dissemination of scientific knowledge. While bioethics is largely concerned with safety and security issues, it is evident that there is a large movement within bioethical and governmental bodies of power to increase accessibility to synthetic biology and its underlying principles. Within the umbrella of the iGEM competition our project and work is publicly available maintaining transparency in everything that we have done so as to ensure we are upholding principle values of bioethics.  The idea of catering our project to general gene integration for research purposes was becoming progressively more appealing. However, we didn't want to give up on gene therapy just yet... 
"
Calgary,Integrated,Spiritual Care Advisory Committee Calgary Zone Meeting,"The Spiritual Care Advisory Committee members we spoke with consisted of Spiritual Health Practitioners, 
              a family physician, and a community member from various religious denominations including Christianity, Sikhism, 
              Islam and Buddhism. These individuals work closely with families and patients to provide support and encourage spiritual well-being, 
              whether it be through active listening or the provision of rituals or ceremonies. Furthermore, 
              they provide a conduit between public and spiritual views, while having first-hand experience in patient care. 

These thought leaders provided unique, faith-based perspectives on the ideas of genetic modification, biotechnology, 
          and the potential implications of gene therapy. Although it was agreed that therapies which improve the 
          livelihood of humanity are beneficial, there were reservations in the use of a system which could be 
          viewed as altering the natural order. It was evident from our conversation that current society is not
          wholly prepared for wide-scale use of genetic modification for therapeutic purposes. Specifically, the 
          potential for alterations to the human genome for the sake of enhancement or targeting embryonic 
          modifications were topics that were met with caution. Interestingly, the topic of eradicating defined 
          cultures associated with genetically linked disorders such as deafness or dwarfism was brought up as a 
          negative consequence to gene therapies. Ultimately, it was determined that our team was not equipped to 
          fully counter the negative connotations and safety concerns that accompany the project’s therapeutic 
          applications on a large-scale. As a result, we felt it was apt to limit the scope of our project to an 
          issue shared by both gene therapy and general gene integration within research: reliable gene delivery 
          and activation.
"
Calgary,Integrated,Conclusion,"
Ultimately, our project direction was swayed by the feedback which we received through our human practices work. While we were initially gung-ho about gene therapy, issues related to safety, ethics, and public viewpoint were brought to our attention which began to dissuade us. Through meetings with research experts, religious thought leaders, the general public, and our own literature review, we came to the conclusion that shifting our project focus to a research-based application was salient. The potential impact of designing a system to address universal problems within gene integration was equally important, but the issues surrounding it were significantly less. Thus, our project pivoted from a gene therapy platform to a gene integration platform for the fundamental advancement of biology.

The chart below depicts the landscape of the field which we explored this summer; the problems which we hoped to address, integration and maintenance of genes, are a core component of gene therapy. However, gene therapy has a host of other issues on the side which we were not equipped to address. Fortunately, the issues of integration and maintenance are equally applicable to other research areas. Therefore, we addressed those issues within the context of a research platform as opposed to tackling the baggage associated with gene therapy.

Faculty Talk

                In May of 2018, our team held a informational presentation outlining our preliminary ideas and plans for researchers, doctors,
                and general interest groups at the University of Calgary. Our team used this time as an opportunity to connect
                with the individuals who are most likely to utilize our system in the future and listen to feedback surrounding
                our project. More about the feedback we received during this meeting can be found in our
                Integrated Human Practices page. One of our other dominant purposes of holding this information session
                was to educate researchers and professionals about our future plans regarding this system. We held this talk
                early in the summer to increase awareness and relevance of our project. A common theme we encountered in
                our early human practices discussions included concerns about the ethics and connotations surrounding a “gene
                therapy” project. We wanted to make sure that we had reached out properly to the target users of our system
                and addressed these concerns directly."
Calgary,Public Engagement,Students,"
International Baccalaureate Curriculum
In an effort to engage with aspiring scientists worldwide, our team sought to create a new synthetic biology
                addition to the International Baccalaureate Organization program. The IB Biology Higher Level curriculum
                contains a variety of “optional studies,” where students are able to choose which topic to write on for their
                exam. Our team planned to create a novel “synthetic biology” option for high school IB students. We drafted
                a rough outline of the contents of a synthetic biology option, which we brought to discuss with IB teachers
                at Father Lacombe High School and Western Canada High School.
            However, after meeting with Mr. Norman Hounjet (IB Coordinator), Mrs. Marija Susnjar (IB Coordinator), and Ms.
                Anna Majczak (IB Biology teacher) at Father Lacombe High School and Susan Rivers (IB Coordinator) at Western
                Canada High School, we were informed that the IB Organization had already passed their period of public corroboration
                for their upcoming curriculum change. Regardless, we have included our preliminary plans for a curriculum
                component
                here and we urge any high schools with flexibility in their curriculums to integrate synthetic biology
                concepts into their learning.
            
High School Lesson Plan
A common theme heard throughout meetings with Father Lacombe High School Teachers and Western Canada High School
                was that teachers would be more willing to integrate single-class lesson plans into their regular curriculum
                rather than an entire curriculum change. Taking this feedback, our team designed a lesson plan for a “Synthetic
                Biology 101” lesson, including a powerpoint on introductory synthetic biology and common laboratory techniques,
                as well as a strawberry DNA extraction activity.This lesson plan is approximately 1.5 hours long and is intended for high school students in grade 11 or 12 with
                some but not extensive previous knowledge on cell biology. A full work-through of the lesson-plan can be
                found
                here. Alternatively, a printable version is available through
                this link.
            
Notre Dame Collegiate High School iGEM Graphic Design Workshop
After hearing that the
                Notre Dame Collegiate High School iGEM team enjoyed our graphic design during the aGEM (Alberta) competition, we
                decided to hold a graphic design workshop for their team. Rainer, our team’s graphic designer, walked a few
                members of the Notre Dame team through tips and tricks for creating eye-catching logos, diagrams, and slide-shows.
                We specifically worked with their team to upgrade their logo and provided a list of resources for them to
                refer to for their future graphic design needs."

Telus Spark's Adults Only Night
Our team participated in the “Hack It” event at Telus Spark’s Adults Only Night in September 2018, where we hosted
                a booth to promote our project and spread synthetic biology awareness in the community. We brought a hands-on
                Strawberry DNA Extraction activity, where community members could make drinkable strawberry daiquiris. At
                our booth, we promoted Snip, Equip, Flip and answered any outstanding questions surrounding gene editing
                and integration. Response from the public was positive, and we were glad to have had this opportunity to
                showcase our project to the members of the community.We have outlined our procedure for strawberry DNA daiquiri activity in our
                protocols page - we believe that adults, not just children, can learn about and have fun with science.
            
Thought Leaders Meeting
Our team strongly believes that we, as scientists, should always consider and respect the varying faiths, doctrines,
                and perspectives of the general public. As a result, we decided to meet with the Alberta Health Services’
                Spiritual Care Advisory Committee, a group of religious thought leaders from different faiths involved in
                healthcare-related decision-making in Alberta. We explained our project and its applications both as a research
                tool and as a gene therapy tool. Our project received great support from their team, which expressed great
                interest in integrating the core components of our project into their outreach efforts in the community.
                The Spiritual Care Advisory Committee often works closely with patients in our healthcare system - by reaching
                out through them, we were able to communicate to the general public about the uses of our project.

North American iGEM Kickoff
The Calgary team participated in and hosted the North American iGEM Kickoff in July 2018. We were joined in person by several Alberta iGEM teams and video called with teams from around North America. We were able to establish collaborations and learn about other teams’ projects. Specifically, we began planning our collaboration with the Lethbridge team. The Kickoff also involved several workshops hosted by synthetic biology entrepreneurs and iGEM alumni. These were very useful for constructing a narrative, hearing more about the realm of synthetic biology, and wiki design principles. 
aGEM
Our team participated in and hosted the aGEM event at the University of Calgary on September 22 and 23, 2018. Along with 6 other iGEM teams, we presented our project to a panel of judges, who are all involved with iGEM. We were extremely thankful to receive feedback following our presentation, regarding our visual presentation slides, content, and presenting style. This feedback was readily incorporated into the presentation we are preparing for iGEM. We also had the opportunity to learn about and collaborate with other Alberta iGEM teams.  Notably, we began a collaboration with the Notre Dame Collegiate High School.  "
Cardiff Wales,Human Practices,Human Practices," As part of our human practices, we communicated with several different stakeholders and professionals to assess whether they thought that our project was a good idea, and obtained the opinions of each stakeholder about our project and genetic modification of crops in general. Compiling the discussions with Tony Shaw (Welsh Beekeepers Association, WBKA president) and Jonathan Harrington (an agronomist), led us to bioinformatically analyse any foreseeable effects that our RNAi constructs could have on bees and aphid predators alike. More details of these results can be seen on our bioinformatics page. This page serves to highlight who we communicated with, and what their views were.

"
Cardiff Wales,Human Practices,Agronomist ,"Our meeting with agronomist Jonathan Harrington provided us with information of the current pest controls widely used across the UK, including those used by some of the farmers that he advises. He discussed with us the current chemical sprays commonly used; in particular these were Neonicotinoids and Synthetic pyrethroids. It takes only 5 maize seeds treated with the Neonicotinoid spray to kill a single grey partridge, says Professor David Gouson, of Sussex University(1). These are used in the UK on oil seed rape. Their toxins can remain in the soil for up to a year, or for even longer periods of time if used on the same areas repeatedly. This year the EU banned the use of 3 neonicotinoids - but is this enough? 

An article in New Scientist has highlighted the depth of research into the effects this type of pesticide has on bumble bees. The toxic residues make their way from the field into hives and have an impact on the number of new queen bees. This leads to reductions in egg cell numbers within beehives(2). 
Synthetic pyrethroids show great resistance by pests against their anti-feeding mechanism and are also seen to be degraded by light, lowering their efficiency. 

We were surprised to find that 90-95% of winter cereals are sprayed with chemical pesticides, confirmed by a representative of NIAB and Norfolk's regional agronomist, Stephen Keach. This is mostly due to a huge price reduction in recent years caused by the massive growth in the pesticide market. This has multiplied to accommodate the expansion in global agriculture which has developed to meet the food supply demands of an ever increasing worldwide population. 

During our discussion, Jonathan indicated that the aims of our project, to replace chemical pesticide use, would avoid wiping out populations of beneficial insects such as the carabid beetle. Current sprays wipe out these insects giving rise to other pest populations. He also saw no ethical reasons why farmers would be opposed to using a GM crop in the field - the only barrier being cost comparison against current methods. This is confirmed by a survey by Farmers Weekly, where 61% of the participating farmers favoured growing GM crops on their land(3). Agriculture is a booming economic business, and perhaps it would be beneficial to increase taxation on chemical sprays in an effort to conserve the environment. "
Cardiff Wales,Human Practices,Welsh Environment Minister ,"As part of our survey we explored the cohort’s knowledge on current EU laws surrounding GM crops and their opinions on potential changes following Brexit negotiations. Currently there is a solid legal framework followed by EU countries under the commission directive of 2018 that aims to protect all residing populations of humans and animals, requiring safety assessment at EU level prior to a GMO being available to enter the market(4). Alongside this, clear labelling is essential to enable all consumers and businesses to be aware of what they are buying. 

The UK’s legislation on GM crops aims to protect the environment and people. At present this allows the importation of GMOs but does not allow them to be legally grown. According to the Huffington post, “30 million tonnes of GM animal feed is thought to be imported into Europe each year to feed pigs, poultry, dairy and beef cattle, as well as farmed fish. The UK imports an estimated 140,000 tonnes of GM soy bean and as much as 300,000 tonnes of GM maize annually for use as animal feed”(5). So, with a country so reliant in GMOs as imports, why not allow GMO use in the UK's agricultural industry? With recent Brexit negotiations, much speculation around these current laws has come to light in the media. One article stated that if post Brexit, the UK is offered the chance to take more advantage of GMOs, projecting Brexit will “flood” the country with American GMOs(6).

We looked to find a clear answer as to whether Wales would alter the current restrictions upon the growing of GMOs. Hannah Blythyn, the Welsh Environment Minister told us the restrictions will remain the same. But we remain optimistic for future change as she believes an open mind should be kept on GM developments. Her correspondence is detailed in the PDF below, or it can be downloaded here.

"
Cardiff Wales,Human Practices,Welsh Beekeepers’ Association ,"
Contacting the Welsh Bee Keeper’s Association was very beneficial in gaining a clear understanding of the relationship between aphids and honey bees, as well as the great effect current pesticides have upon bumblebee populations. Bee harming pesticides are found in 75% of honey worldwide(7) and a newly developed pesticide, Sulfoxaflor (used in 47 countries worldwide), is currently under review for licencing in the UK. It is likely to be a replacement to the current Neonics, yet it poses a great threat to bee populations; one experiment saw a reduction in the new generation population of 54%(8). It is great to see developments to remove the current toxic and harmful pesticides, but we believe this should not be with another chemical pesticide that will not protect beneficial populations, such as bumblebees, but may still cause harm. 

The WBKA saw great opportunity in our correspondence and decided to support our study. They were also eager to demonstrate their capacity to help other universities and students in research. To help with this we have produced an article about our project, and their support, which will be published in their next quarterly magazine.

Cardiff Wales,Public Engagement,Human Practices: Education and Public Engagement Special Prize," As a team, we attended several different outreach events to engage with the public, increasing their knowledge and understanding of our project and genetic modification in general. In turn, we hoped to improve our awareness of what the public's opinions actually are."
Cardiff Wales,Public Engagement,Cardiff University Open Days,"
The University runs several open days across the academic year, and we were lucky enough to attend 3 open days to demonstrate plant infiltrations and communicate with prospective students about activities outside of their studies, such as iGEM. Many of the students and parents were amazed at the opportunities that Cardiff offered at undergraduate level and eagerly discussed our project including the ethical issues of GM, and also the project's potential effects. "
Cardiff Wales,Public Engagement,3G Genetics Conference,"
This was the first event our team attended, and one of the most enriching. In deep and sometimes controversial discussion with the attendees, we observed great interest in our student led project and keen discussion of their views on genetic modification. Many of the people we spoke to came from many years of study, or careers in science - they gave us great depth of knowledge on the issues surrounding our project. Speaking with one attendee, Miriam Knight of the Gwent Beekeepers Association, led us to give more thought to the potential effect of our project on bumblebees. For further research, we then looked to contact additional beekeeping associations - leading us to integrate our human practices. "
Cardiff Wales,Public Engagement,Techniquest ,"
Techniquest is an interactive science museum located in Cardiff Bay. They openly welcomed us to attend their 'Operation Earth' event, which fitted well with the theme of our project, the environment being the central discussion point of the day. 
Tiny children in large lab coats made for great fun for everyone at the event, as we greatly extended our interactive activities to engage the public - both children and parents were excited to participate, exploring new concepts and giving us their own thoughts and opinions. 

The first stage of our activities was by far the messiest! Here, participants did their very own strawberry DNA extraction followed by a plant infiltration. After seeing some DNA, and finding out more about the basis of all living things, the participants then moved to learn about genetic modification on a basic level with our 3D printed plant model showing colour changes with new gene insertions into the plant. Finally, the last activity involved our feely boxes - a hidden object needed to be guessed only using touch. These objects have all been genetically modified in research, and we discussed with the participants from what organism the foreign genes may have come from. At this point, we received the most stimulating discussions on our project and genetic modification on a whole. "
Cardiff Wales,Public Engagement,Talk with Sixth Form Students at Ysgol Bryn Elian ,"
As another part of our public outreach, a member of our team visited a secondary school in North Wales, to have a discussion with sixth form students about the applications of GM and their opinions on using GM to produce crops. We discussed with the students about current commercial uses of GM, and how our project utilises GM plants as an alternative to chemical pesticides. As part of this, the students were asked to fill in a short questionnaire, noting down their opinions on GM crops and any benefits they see from the use of them. The response to the questionnaire was overwhelmingly positive with every student saying they agree with the use of GM to produce crops. Every student also said that they can see benefits from using GM crops, with the most common benefits noted being the production of more nutritious food, higher crop yields, a longer shelf life of foods, and the ability to grow crops in harsher environments. The students also discussed the concerns that they have with the use of GM to produce crops. The most common concerns were the possible side effects on humans or other organisms, allergies and companies possibly overcharging farmers for their GM product. Several students said they have no concerns over the use of GM to produce crops, often stating that this is due to the strict laws surrounding the use of GM to produce food in the UK. Also, as part of the questionnaire, the students were asked about how they think the public in general view GM. Many of students felt that the public is becoming more accepting of GM and that it's starting to be viewed in a more positive light, whilst some of the students felt that there is generally a negative attitude towards GM which comes from a lack of understanding. This was a beneficial public outreach experience which allowed us to have a discussion with a group of young people about their opinions on the use of GM to produce crops. "
Cardiff Wales,Public Engagement,Super Science Saturday! at the National Museum of Wales ,"
Our final outreach event was at the National Museum of Wales, at Super Science Saturday. Again, we loved running our interactive activities to help the children. On completion of all the science activities and games, collecting stamps along the way, the children were given badges and prizes. Our stall involved strawberry DNA extraction, the use of the 3D printed leaf light, and feely boxes where the children had to guess what was in the box, and guess what we may do to genetically modify them. Again, this generated a lot of interest from children and parents alike. "
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,"
              Human Practices 
            "," The aim of our human practices work was to spread the word about synthetic biology and to consider our work in ethical and environmental aspects. We also wanted to get valuable feedback from people outside of the team, both experts and the general public, in order to further develop the project. For outreach, we got interviewed by the local newspaper Göteborgs-Posten, held presentations about our project at the university and kept our social media up-to-date. To put our product in a societal context, we investigated current treatment and detection methods and Swedish laws and regulations concerning genetically modified drugs. We had meetings with several experts and used their feedback to change our path during the course of the summer. We met with the oncology professor Mef Nilbert that gave us advice regarding our project idea. Mef Nilbert made us consider alternative detection methods and broadened our perspective on the potential uses of our product. We also met with Mike Vega, Vice President of Business Development & Sales at Verasonics and collaborator with Shapiro's lab, the lab that wrote the paper about acoustic reporter genes (Bourdeau et al., 2018). Mike Vega gave us information regarding transducers that guided us in our ultrasound experiments. We designed an experimental survey based on the advice from the philosophy professor Karl de Fine Licht. The survey helped us to evaluate our product from a patient point of view and to understand how to best reach out with our project to society. Carl Johan Franzén, professor in bioreaction engineering, gave us guidance regarding ethical and environmental issues. Based on his guidance, we evaluated the effects that our yeast could have on patient health and the environment. In turn, this made us consider how we could avoid possible negative effects caused by our product. Below, we describe our human practices journey in more detail. For information about our outreach work and to read about our collaborations with other iGEM teams, please visit our outreach and collaborations pages.

Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Current Methods and Research,"In order to evaluate the need for our yeast pill in health care, we considered the most common detection and treatment 
options for colon cancer available today. We also looked into current research. Based on our findings we concluded that there is a need for an easy and non-invasive method for colon cancer detection as well as more efficient treatment options. In this section, we have summarized the information that we found during our background search."
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Detection,"One of the most common methods for detecting colon cancer is colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is an invasive method that requires the patient to adapt food intake and to use laxatives prior to the examination (Simon, 2016). As an alternative to colonoscopy, the colon can be examined by x-ray with CT colonography. The colonography is semi-invasive but still requires the patient to prepare for the examination as for the colonoscopy (Simon, 2016). Non-invasive detection methods where blood or abnormal DNA is detected in the stool are available. FOBT or fecal immunochemical tests can be used at home and detects hemoglobin in the stool (Simon, 2016). The drawbacks of these tests are that they have a low detection rate of precancerous lesions and that they can give false results as a consequence of diet (Simon, 2016). Multi-targeted stool DNA tests, mt-sDNA, that combines the detection of blood together with abnormal DNA has shown to have a higher sensitivity compared to FOBT and FIT (Simon, 2016). To find non-invasive detection methods that are more specific and sensitive than those that are available today, research is put into the development of nanosensors. Nanosensors could for example detect volatile compounds that are indications of colon cancer in the breath (Peng et al., 2010) or urine (Arasaradnam et al., 2014). Since nanosensors only need a small amount of sample, they would be both fast and easy to use (Salvati, Stellacci,  & Krol, 2015). Another field of research revolves around the microbiota and its connection to the presence of cancer in the colon. It has been found that the relative abundance of species in the gut differs between healthy individuals and individuals with colon cancer (Zackular, Rogers, Ruffin, & Schloss, 2014). This could be exploited to detect this type of cancer in an early stage (Zackular et al., 2014).  Early detection has a key role in survival of colon cancer patients. Regular screening of people in the risk group of developing colon cancer is therefore of importance (National cancer institute, 2018). Factors that can contribute to low screening rates are complications around the screening procedure such as fear and lack of resources (National cancer institute, 2018). Research is put on how to increase the screening rates with one of the option being patient-reach out in order to increase awareness (National cancer institute, 2018). In addition to this, cheaper, easier and faster detection methods might encourage more people to do regular check-ups. "
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Treatment,"Today, surgery is commonly the first choice in the treatment of colon cancer. However, in 1 out of 2 patients undergoing surgery, the cancer recurs (PDQ Adult treatment editorial board, 2018). Other treatment options are radiation therapy and chemotherapy which can also be combined with surgery (PDQ Adult treatment editorial board, 2018). Both of the latter treatment options cause side effects such as weakness and diarrhea (Cancer research UK, 2015).Research is put into the field of personalized oncology in order to personalize cancer treatment based on genomic profiling. In this way, the treatment becomes more effective while side effects are reduced (Rosenblum & Peer, 2014). In the field of personalized oncology, omics data describing for example enzymatic activity is used to decide which therapy to employ. The data can also be used to monitor drug response and adjust drug dosage (Rosenblum & Peer, 2014). In relation to genome profiling, better understanding of mutations that could cause cells to become cancerous has led to the development of targeted therapies (Rosenblum & Peer, 2014). An example of a targeting therapy is use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies that inhibit EGFR signaling (Martinelli, De Palma, Orditura, & De Vita, 2009). EGFR is involved in important cellular transduction pathways (Martinelli et al., 2009) and has found to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer (Rosenblum & Peer, 2014). Research is also put into the development of new immunotherapies that can be used for colorectal cancer (Kalyan, Kircher, Shah, Mulcahy,  & Benson, 2018).  Immunotherapy focuses on stimulating the immune response to fight the cancer and has shown to be successful in the treatment of other cancer types (Kalyan et al., 2018). There are several kinds of immunotherapies, including therapeutic vaccines and oncolytic virus therapy, that are under review for treatment of colon cancer (Kalyan et al., 2018). "
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Laws and Regulations,Since our project is based around a probiotic GM yeast that is engineered to combat colorectal cancer there are inevatibly laws which regulate this sort of drug. In this section we aim to give an overview of some of the administrations and agencies that deal with the regulations of GM pharmaceuticals. We also want to highlight some of the interactions we have had with these agencies. 
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Regulations of GM Drugs,"The swedish laws are governed by the general EU-regulations. This means that proper information about any GMO trials performed in sweden must be reported to the EU and fulfill their general criteria. However the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) is the national authority responsible for regulation and surveillance of the development, manufacturing and sale of drugs and other medicinal products. Their task is to ensure that both the individual patient and healthcare professionals have access to safe and effective medicinal products and that these are used in a rational and cost-effective manner. Even though the MPA has the final say in whether or not a clinical trial is approved there are some other agencies of interest when it comes to the regulation of pharmaceuticals in Sweden. 
There is an institution called “Gentekniknämnden” or “the Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board”, founded in 1994, that is meant to serve as a connection between researchers and politicians in regards to decision making related to GMO. The board has a consulting role and its goal is to make sure that gene editing techniques are used in a responsible and sustainable way. The board also releases statements about clinical trials related to GMO and is tasked with “spreading information about the advancements in genetic engineering”. The board is made up of two representative people from each of the major swedish political parties (there are currently eight parties in the government) seven experts within ethics and biotechnology and two legal practitioners. Click here to visit their websiteAnother institution that deals with these topics is the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics (SMER). It works as an advisory board to the Swedish government and parliament on ethical issues raised by technological and scientific advances in the biomedicine area. They also consist of representatives from all the eight major political parties and various experts within the fields of ethics, law, psychology and health. This council delivers statements of opinion about various issues within the field of biomedicine to the Minister of Health and Social Affairs. Click here to visit their website There are also some additional Swedish laws that apply when preparing clinical trials for GM products. For example as soon as a human trial is started it is considered a “Deliberate release” of GM products into the environment. This means that MPA needs to evaluate the suggested trial from both an environmental and a medical standpoint. The Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board and the Swedish National Council of Medical Ethics are also often involved and give out statements and input in regards to the applications for clinical trials. When a GM trial is initiated anybody who wants to is free to contact the MPA to give their input on the release of GMO into the environment within the three first weeks of the decision making period. Also, all pharmaceuticals that contain any modified organism need to be labeled with “This product contains (a) genetically modified organism(s)”.  All of the trials regarding GM pharmaceuticals are posted on the Swedish Medical Products Agency’s website, which you can find here."
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Contact with Institutions," In order to get a better understanding of what Swedish laws that govern the use of GM probiotics we decided to approach a few of the key institution that deals with pharmaceuticals and other GM products.Our team has been in contact with the Swedish Gene Technology Advisory Board and SMER to ask them which Swedish laws and regulations would affect a GM probiotic. They did not have a concrete answer, instead  we were referred to the MPA to ask them if our product would be counted as a food supplement, like most regular probiotics, or if it would be classified as a pharmaceutical. After a discussion with a spokesperson for the MPA, we were told to send a description of our project so they could evaluate how it should be classified.The response simply stated that they could not give any information about a specific product/project but they referred to the “Medicinal Products Act” which states that a pharmaceutical is :”Every substance or combination of substances that is provided under the pretense that it has a preventative or therapeutic effect on diseases in humans or animals”. 
So, in the case of GM probiotics for treatments of diseases it is obvious that our product would be treated as a pharmaceutical and not as a supplement."
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Meeting with Vice President of Business Development & Sales at Verasonics,"We met with Mike Vega, Vice President of Business Development & Sales at Verasonics, a company that manufactures ultrasound instruments. Mike Vega also collaborated with Shapiro's lab, the lab that wrote the paper about acoustic reporter genes (Bourdeau et al., 2018). Mike Vega gave us information regarding transducers that later on guided us in our ultrasound experiments with yeast. In addition to that, he pointed out to us that our plan of using gas vesicles for non-invasive imaging might not work and told us that we might want to consider other alternatives."
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Meeting with Professor in Oncology,"Mef Nilbert is a professor in oncology at Lunds University and at Copenhagen University. She has worked with inheritable cancer tumors and has a deep knowledge of colon cancers and their behaviour. We first came in contact with Mef Nilbert thanks to Olle Bergman, one of the judges at the Nordic iGEM conference in Lund. Olle Bergman is a Swedish journalist that is specialized in different types of communications. He was a great asset for many of the teams participating in the Nordic iGEM conference, providing us with advice on how to communicate through text, for example in a poster, and connected teams with relevant people. Olle Bergman was kind to connect us with Mef Nilbert so that we could discuss our project and its possibilities with her. The meeting with Mef Nilbert was very helpful. We had a chance to ask an expert all kinds of question related to colon cancer. Gladly, Mef Nilbert was overall positive to our project and our idea. She had a strong belief that there is a need for fast, easy and accurate detection and treatment for colon cancer since this type of cancer is generally diagnosed at a late stage. Mef Milbert had ideas about how we could develop our project. As an example, she suggested that the yeast could be used as a preventative measure and not only for detection and treatment. Unfortunately, Mef Nilbert further confirmed what Mike Vega had told us; she did not think that our detection method would work. She said that it most certainly would be hard to distinguish the gas vesicles, with all the movement and gas that already is in the colon, using only ultrasound. She suggested that we should look for a marker that could be used to detect colon cancer, for example some secreted molecule that could be detected in the stool. With this new information from Mef Nilbert, we decided to see if we could find some possible alternatives to the gas vesicles that could be coupled to our system. "
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Alternative Methods,"So what other methods would be applicable to our product? For diagnosis and localization of the cancer, the most favorable approach would be expression of an MRI detectable reporter gene in the yeast. These give accurate indication of the location of the host cell, and the depth of tissue is not an issue (Srivastava & Bulte, 2014). There are several possible candidate genes for this, as described in the review “Seeing Stem Cells at Work In Vivo” by Srivastava and Bulte (Srivastava & Bulte, 2014). With this approach, the final product would work in the same way as our previously designed system, but with MRI used for screening instead of ultrasound. Another promising approach that allows for detection, but not localization, is through the use of DNA-recording devices. More specifically, DNA-recording devices in which a specific cell stimulus of choice induces permanent changes in the host genome, which can then be read through DNA sequencing at a later date (Seth & Wang, 2018). One such method, Temporal recording in arrays by CRISPR expansion (TRACE), performs recording through CRISPR-mediated sequential spacer sequence integration into a genomic locus (Seth & Wang, 2018). In our system, induction of TRACE by the pFUS promoter would allow for quantitative DNA encoding of yeast cell density (Seth & Wang, 2018). By sequencing the integration locus of Saccharomyces boulardii  from fecal samples obtained from the patient, it would then be possible to determine whether pFUS expression occurred, and to which extent. This would not only provide information about the presence of cancer, but could also indicate treatment progression and has a possibility of predicting tumor size, since the size of the tumor correlates with pFUS expression. "
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Meeting with Lector in Practical Philosophy,"In order to get insight into the ethical prospects of our project, we met with Karl de Fine Licht, a lector within practical philosophy at both Gothenburg University and Sahlgrenska Hospital University. The reason why we wanted to have a meeting with Karl de Fine Licht is that he has worked with bioethics, and we thought he could give us some important views on our project and hopefully some good advice, which was also the case. The meeting with Karl de Fine Licht was very informative and we were able to go into some really interesting ethical aspects of our project. We came to the conclusion that we basically have two ethical approaches to consider. Firstly, we had to consider how we wanted to reach out with our product to the society; how we would present it in order to reach out to as many people as possible. We wanted to describe our project transparently in a way that makes people understand how our product works, without provoking preconceptions. 
Together with Karl de Fine Licht, we discussed our plan of making some kind of a survey to detect common fears of GMO. Our plan was that we could use this when reaching out with our product. Karl de Fine Licht suggested that we should do an experimental survey instead of a regular one to get clearer results. In an experimental survey, the respondents are handed a scenario in which they have to take different stand points. By creating the same scenario but describing it in two separate ways, it is possible to see if people react differently depending on how the scenario is described. For example, the same scenario can be described, but the difference is that the main character is a man in one scenario and a woman in the other. Do people think of the main character in different ways depending on if it is a man or a woman? By doing an experimental survey, it is possible to detect psychological mechanisms in the society rather than peoples opinion. The reason for this is that in this kind of survey you get a context to every question. Karl de Fine Licht informed us that the psychological mechanisms within a society tend to be less varied than the opinions, which would make it easier for us to interpret the tendencies in the result. Karl de Fine Licht suggested that we could do an experimental survey where our project is described in two separate ways. The first description could be non-academic and describe our project in an easy but correct way while the other could describe our project in a more academic way and use words such as genomic modifications and mutations. We want to thank Karl de Fine Licht for giving us an opportunity to discuss our project with him and for giving us input on the ethical aspects of our project, and for the great idea about how we could improve our survey."
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Experimental Survey,"To get a sense of how people would react to our product if it was out on the market, we decided to make an experimental survey based on the advice from Karl de Fine Licht. We created two different versions of a scenario where we described our product and how it potentially could be used, to see how people would react to it. In the first version of the scenario, which we called the academic version, we described our product in a way that may be interpreted as controversial. In this version, words like gene modification, mutation and generally more academic terms were used. In the other version we tried to avoid academic terms as much as possible and to describe our product and its use in an easy way. The aim with the survey was to see if there were any trends or differences in the reactions to the two versions. The survey was written in three languages; Swedish, Italian and English in order to get as varied target group as possible. The English version of the survey can be found here. Below, a summary of the answers to the survey are presented in pie charts where all answers have been translated into English. The blue pie charts present the answers to the academic versions of the scenario and the green charts present the answers to the non-academic versions. We received a total of 145 answers to the survey and approximately half of the respondents answered to the academic version and half to the non-academic version. We were hoping to get at least 100 respondents per scenario version in order to be able to statistically verify our results. However, we think that 145 answers can still provide some guidance regarding what people think of a product like ours. When looking at the summarized results we can see that the respondents have answered similarly to the two different versions. We can see a slightly higher acceptance of our product in the academic version, which is opposite to what we expected. Since we do not have enough answers, we cannot establish that there is a significant difference. However, we might be able to say that people seems to be positive towards this kind of treatment even though it includes eating gene modified yeast. It might even be the case that people are more positive towards the treatment when the information about it seems more professional and scientific. From the written answers in the survey it appears to be the easiness and the immediate start of the treatment that convinced most people to take the yeast pill both for detection and treatment and as a preventative measure. For the respondents that did not want to use the yeast treatment, the reason appears to be lack of testing and risk information about the product. How could they know that it was trustworthy? The written answers have been summarized here."
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Meeting with Associate Professor in Biolotechnology Field,"Carl Johan Franzén is an associate professor in bioreaction engineering at Chalmers University of Technology. He has not only experience of working with yeast, but he has also been a part of the ethical committee at Chalmers University. We thought that it was a great opportunity to discuss our project with Carl Johan Franzén to hopefully get an expert’s view on our idea. The meeting with Carl Johan Franzén was rewarding, and it resulted in a discussion about the risks that comes with our product. He reminded us that it is not only important to look at the risks of the yeast being ingested by the patient, but to also consider what will happen when it leaves the body. Is it for example possible that the inserted genes will spread in nature and what will happen if they do? We made our best to do an unbiased and probable evaluation of the potential risks with our product. "
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Patient Safety," Since the final product, a pill containing freeze-dried Saccharomyces Boulardii, is ingested by the patient it is important that the safety of the patient is considered. In our case this mainly concerns the relationship between the yeast and the gut, in terms of the probability of the yeast outgrowing the gut bacteria and colonizing the gut. From literature covering the subject of S.boulardii as a probiotic, we can conclude that this is not likely. In medical studies it has been shown that in patients that ingest S. boulardii continuously over a period of time, the probiotic yeast concentration in the colon reaches a steady state after 3 days (Czerucka, D. et al. 2007).  Furthermore, it was found that in 96 % of the patients, the fecal concentration of  S.boulardii was undetectable 3 days after dosing had stopped (Elmer et al., 1999) and that the yeast remained in the gut at most 4 days after stopped dosing (Czerucka, D. et al. 2007). This, together with the GRAS status of S. boulardii, let us assume that the yeast is unable to colonize the gut on its own, and that it will not outgrow the gut microbiota.  With the safety of the unmodified S. boulardii confirmed, the next question to address is if our system could affect patient safety once implemented in the yeast. The probability of this is low, considering that the pheromone sensing system in some cases causes cell cycle arrest (Williams et al., 2013), and thus inhibits the growth of the yeast to some extent. The risk of gut colonization by yeast overgrowth is thereby not likely caused by our system. If we next consider the anchor binding, our goal is to make the yeast bind specifically to the cancer cells and not offsite to the healthy gut cells. Based on this, we can conclude that with a functioning system the yeast should only remain in the gut if the patient has cancer. Of course, extensive preclinical testing of the probiotic would be necessary to confirm this."
Chalmers-Gothenburg,Human Practices,Environmental Safety,"One commonly used argument against genetically modified organisms is that they can spread in the ecosystem and, with them, their genetic material. There is a possibility that our genetically modified S. boulardii will survive in the sewage system and eventually end up in nature. Therefore, we considered what will happen with our yeast once it leaves the body of the patient together with the feces. One of the main risks with our modified yeast being released into the sewage system is the risk of spreading the ampicillin resistance gene, present in the plasmids used for transformation, to bacteria. However, transfer of genetic material from yeast to bacteria has not been observed (Czerucka, Piche, & Rampal, 2007). In addition to this, the genetic material transformed into S. boulardii would optimally be implemented into the yeast genome in the final product, thereby eliminating the risk of spreading ampicillin resistance.We asked ourselves if our yeast could harm the nature by release of target molecule. We deemed this unlikely since the probability that our S. boulardii will accumulate in nature is expected to be low. The reason for this is the low probability of the yeast having cells to bind to, combined with the low probability of several yeast cells binding to the same cell, or cells in proximity to each other. As a result of this, it is not likely that the FUS1 promoter will be activated by the alpha pheromone sensing system. This means that our yeast would behave as normal, unmodified, S. boulardii (see the section on patient safety). Consider the possibility that the FUS1 promoter is activated by some other means than by the alpha pheromone system. In this scenario, the amounts of anti-cancer agent released are expected to be low and the resulting concentrations in nature are assumed to be neglectable. The reason for this is the small probability of several yeast cells, expressing anti-cancer agent, accumulating in one place. We therefore consider the risk of our yeast harming nature via release of anti-cancer agent to be small. In a future prospect, a kill switch could be introduced into our S. boulardii in order to make sure that it will not make any harm to the environment after it has left the body of the patient. One possibility is to combine a temperature sensor with a phosphate sensor, killing the yeast when the low temperature outside of the body is combined with the lower concentrations of phosphate in the wastewater (iGEM NUS Singapore, 2017)."
Duesseldorf,Human Practices,Visit from Forensic Biologist Dr. Mark Benecke," Dr. Mark Benecke, a known forensic biologist not only in Germany but also worldwide, did not only work for the FBI, but also became a forensic expert for biological traces after moving back to Germany. Therefore he plays an important role in solving criminal problems in our country. 

Dr. Benecke immediately caught our attention when he gave a talk at the March for Science in Cologne, as he is a open minded and interesting person. His research field, his profession and especially the way he is teaching people about science encouraged us to invite him to our university to present our work and our lab. 
Luckily he accepted our invitation and visited us on August 27. We had a very extensive and captivating conversation with him, receiving great advice regarding our story, our project and our way of presenting us. By encouraging us he motivated us to make it to Boston and made us even more enthusiastic about iGEM. We had a lot of fun, especially when recording a video about synthetic biology and our project for the public. This way we created a funny, informative and an internationally accessible brief description of our “Trinity”.
 
Since Dr. Benecke is a worldwide known influencer, we hope that synthetic biology will receive a broader public reach and engagement due to his visit to our laboratory.  
Our successful meeting with Mark Benecke can be seen on the social media platform of our university and is also visible on Mark Benecke's facebook page, ensuring that synthetic biology, the idea behind iGEM and our “Trinity”, is spread.  
 We would like to thank Dr. Benecke for his support and his thoughtful words. We really appreciate his input and learned a lot from his advice. 
We hope that we were able to reach a wider audience with our collaboration with Mark Benecke and were able to show that synthetic biology is not dangerous, but on the contrary, very fun and helpful.
 "
Duesseldorf,Human Practices,A Survey for Everyone," To assess the public’s opinion regarding a future possibility to utilize our toolbox for the synthesis of probiotics, we created a survey with a couple of questions. 
We did not only share this survey on our social media accounts for a short time, but also went to one of Germany’s biggest supermarkets to personally ask customers what they think about genetically engineered probiotics. In total we achieved a participation count of 267 including young community members starting from 14 years and up to older people. Among the participants, male and female people were almost distributed equally. 
Most of the participants were relatively young, ranging from 14 to 30 years old, which is why we  considered that the vast majority of the survey was filled out online. Because of the results from question 3, seen in Figure 1, we assume that most participants are students, probably biologists and familiar with synthetic biology and its hazards. In contrast to that, most of the people we addressed at the supermarket were older, between 30 and 50 years old and frequently even older (+60 years old).
This observation is further enhanced when looking at the answer of question 3: Here most of the participants admitted to having an academic degree. Most survey attendants at the supermarket did not hold an academic degree, but mostly rather had a lower secondary school level or no degree at all. 
Interestingly, independent of age, gender and degree, most of the participants are aware that the intestinal flora has an impact on human health. This conveys that everyone has already heard something about the gut microbiome and the fact that there are indeed living organisms somehow working to improve our health. 
However, when looking at the most frequent answer to question five, some of the participants have never consciously taken probiotics to improve their health. When asking this question in the supermarket, most of the people did not immediately know what probiotics are or what they consist of, until we named some known examples of probiotics and explained them that they harbour microorganisms. This outcome is very peculiar, as most of them are aware that our gut microbiome plays a huge role in our daily life, yet they do not consciously try to improve their health by for example consuming probiotics. 

We believe that this result is due to the lack of trivial information in everyday life which we realized when we encountered a woman suffering from Crohn’s disease in the supermarket. Even though she belonged to the older subgroup of participants, she was very well informed about synthetic biology, GMOs and potential harms. Her age however did not keep her from approving of the consumption of genetically modified organisms if this would improve her health.
Moreover, also when considering the answers of question 6 it can be clearly seen that for us seemingly simple questions like: “What do you consider a genetically modified organism?”, were frequently answered incorrectly. This became obvious to us at the supermarket, when looking at the people struggling to answer this question.

All in all we observed a trend at the supermarket during our chats with the customers. We got the impression that young adults with higher academic degrees tended to be more aware of GMOs. However, similar to the other participants, they rejected the consumption of GMOs as well, even if this would improve their health. 
This clearly indicates that the public is still not very familiar with synthetic biology and its potential benefits.
The last question was whether people would agree to the consumption of genetically engineered probiotics. With our survey and with our personal interaction with the public at the supermarket we can conclude that there is a tendency and acceptance of people to consume synthetically engineered probiotics. We had the impression, that the ones denying the consumption of genetically modified organisms had a distorted image of synthetic biology due to lack of public knowledge regarding this issue.
"
Duesseldorf,Human Practices,Cyano 2018: 3rd Early Career Research Symposium on Cyanobacteria," One of the major key players in our co-culture is Synechococcus elongatus, a cyanobacterium that provides the other organisms with carbon.
Every year a conference on cyanobacteria takes place in Germany where experts meet and discuss recent progress, research and their current projects. Last year it was held at our university in Duesseldorf, which is why our advisors knew of it and advised us to visit the conference this year.
We sent the organizers of this symposium an abstract of our project and were actually accepted to present our project in a 20 minute talk.

On the 12th of September two of our members started their trip to Freiburg, a beautiful city in the South of Germany, where the 3rd symposium for cyanobacteria was held for three days. We were greeted with a lot of sun and temperatures up to 80 °F (30 °C), whereas the other members of our team had to freeze at 15 °C in our lab. 
Every day a couple of talks were held in addition to a presentation from a keynote speaker.
On the first day a team of Serbian scientists presented their research on cyanobacteria in their natural habitat. Slađana Popović even found a new species in a cave in Serbia! Christoph Howe then talked about his idea to use cyanobacterium biofilms for H2 production for biofuels. 
Another interesting idea was the one of Moritz Koch. He presented his idea of cyanobacteria as a PHB producer - a carbon friendly bioplastic against the pollution of the sea on the second day.
In between poster session and discussions we were able to socialize with other cyanobacteria researchers. The organizers even offered a guided tour to the Münster - a famous church in Freiburg and a hike to the Schlossberg (castle rock) which offered a great view over Freiburg and the surrounding hills.
The last day of the conference was the big day for us: We got to present our co-culture project in front of the real experts of cyanobacteria.
After explaining what the iGEM competition is to a lot of the people who hadn’t heard of it, we started detailing our concept around the cyanobacteria in the planned co-culture.
After the talk the audience ended up starting a discussion about our strategy. We are very thankful for the mentioned advice and tried to integrate all the input in our work.

"
Duesseldorf,Human Practices,Expert Discussion with a Pharmacy Employee," The gut flora is a very important network of organisms in our bodies. Itie has a big impact on our overall health, wellbeing and recovery. Just like other microbial consortia, these networks have not yet been extensively studied. Even though it is such a significant aspect of our health affecting drug absorption we try to establish synthetic co-cultures with our toolbox that can be used in many diverse fields. We thought it would be a great idea to talk to an expert about it. Hence, we invited Mrs. Küpper, an employee of the Paracelsus pharmacy. 
After quickly introducing us and iGEM we gave her a presentation about our project and our goals with it for society.

Just like others Mrs. Küpper was very interested and asked many questions about our co-culture.
Especially impressive to her was the fact that the co-culture toolbox can be used in many possible ways - either for production, the cultivation of different organisms, simple research or as probiotics.

She informed us that probiotics currently arouse not only the interest of companies but also of her customers. Every week new products emerge on the market and are sent to the drug store. A lot more people also come to the pharmacy and ask for probiotics against diarrhea or stomach trouble even without being sent by their physicians. A lot of doctors still prescribe antibiotics even for minor illnesses which could be treated otherwise, thus accepting the damage of their patients’ gut flora. Some customers use probiotics to counter the side effects. Some physicians - unfortunately not all - recommend probiotics to their patients. 
Mrs. Küpper also noted that most of her customers are aware that probiotics are living organisms which is why they often ask for the correct storage of the medicine. Dead organisms are used as a sort of vaccine to start the immune system - but then they are not called probiotics anymore.
Since they are not subject to medical prescription the customers need to pay for them themselves. German health insurance doesn’t cover the costs.

In the end she also suggested other applications of our toolbox. The differently built, but similar functioning networks of organisms also exist on the skin or in the mouth that - being impaired - can also cause illnesses. According to her our toolbox could provide important research for those as well.
"
Duesseldorf,Human Practices,Synthetic Biology and Waffles," Our idea behind the small information booth paired with waffle sales was to capture the general knowledge of the students of our university about synthetic biology while “baiting” them with delicious self-made food.
We organized a quiz with general questions about microorganisms, genetic engineering and molecular biology where everybody was able to participate. 
It was interesting to see that biology seems to be very complicated and incomprehensible to many. Many students who were not familiar with biology at all, often failed at the quiz but then were cheered up with a delicious waffle and every information they asked for. Some terms like amino acids and DNA were not familiar to a bunch of participants, but few were able to put the terms into the right context. However, there were some students who had solid knowledge in synthetic biology - despite studying something else - and were also interested in the iGEM competition itself. We were happy to share our knowledge with them and to draw them under the spell of biology while handing out more waffles.
A few other students were already familiar with the iGEM competition itself and visited our booth to find out what this year's topic is about. We were delighted to present our project and were also able to inspire some non-biologists with our idea.
All in all, we were able to arouse interest in synthetic biology with our information booth and were able to enjoy a bunch of waffles. 
Hopefully we were able to contribute to bringing the wonderful world of synthetic biology to many new people and to take away their fear of this often unknown science.

"
Duesseldorf,Human Practices,Radio Interview," The [97.1] Hochschulradio Düsseldorf is a universitarian radio station hosted voluntarily by students of different study fields. Even though there is a lot going on at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences the station only has seldomly the chance to welcome guests with a scientific background which is why they were very happy to invite us. Our team members Salima and Carina were interviewed by Cigdem Ünlü on June 18 at their radio station. 

Our goal was to change their problem, introduce iGEM to a bunch of folks who listen to the station and advertise the upcoming talks of our lecture series. 
When we entered the station we were quite surprised: It’s located in a normal apartment in a big residential block for students. After we were greeted we began right away with asking a lot of questions since we were pretty nervous: Are we prepared enough, what language style should we use, how should we deal with bloopers and who was going to say the important stuff. But it turned out that they were actually quite easy going so we had nothing to worry about.
Cigdem began asking us many questions as soon as we met to prepare for our conversation. Once she was ready, our interview began and everything was broadcasted live. 
At first we were asked about the iGEM competition to give the audience an idea about what it actually is for. iGEM might be well known among scientific faculty members and science students at our university but students in other fields of study are usually not familiar with the term. 
After the quick introduction to the competition we started explaining synthetic biology in more detail - which is a quite unknown expression as well - and gave examples of what we’re actually dealing with next to our research, such as sponsoring, meetings with experts, modeling and spreading the world about synthetic biology.
This was a perfect transition to our past and upcoming outreach projects that Salima quickly presented. We invited all fellow students to come. Our interviewer was quite happy to know that those events were also for non-scientist without any knowledge in synthetic biology. 
Next we had to answer why we joined the iGEM team and mentioned practical experience, our own project and exponential growth eeh learning curves as our motivation. 
This led to our current project - the co-culture consisting of three organisms. We tried to explain our plan in a way that was also understandable for people who didn’t know much about biology. Cigdem asked whenever something was too complicated which gave us a great sense as to what might be hard to understand when you’re not dealing with it everyday and every night.
Before the interview ended we were once again allowed to advertise our upcoming lecture series talks on the radio. 

All in all it was a very interesting experience to talk in front of people you can’t see which gives you a rather odd feeling. We learned how to describe a complex project to people with little knowledge about specific mechanisms and were able to reach people beyond our usually scientifically interested audience.
 "
Duesseldorf,Human Practices,V-Bio Karl-von-Frisch Award Ceremony," Every year the VBIO - an association to promote biology -  awards excellent high school graduates in Biology a prize. Just like the previous year the iGEM team Duesseldorf helped to welcome the students and gave a talk about the iGEM competition in general and their project.
Four members of our team took the train on June 26 and arrived at noon at the BioMedizinZentrum (BMZ)   in Dortmund. After meeting Professor Susanne Bickel and the organiser, we helped them distribute badges to the students in order to mark them as guests. Some cakes and beverages later,  Dipl.-Ing. Michael Kuhn started to give a short introduction about the center. Professor Susanne Bickel then explained the VBIO association, with their goals and tasks and made some advertisement for it, showing the advantages for students. 
After the students came back from a tour that led through the center, it was our turn to present.
We explained the iGEM competition in detail, presented efforts and project ideas of other teams, showed what our current work in the laboratory looks like and presented goals we have in mind for our project. Afterwards, we were drilled with questions. The students showed a lot of interest in the iGEM competition and were curious about possible teams to join. Even a few teachers chimed in.
In the end we had an interesting discussions with some teachers and students regarding our project ideas and our progress.
We left feeling happy about the motivation and inspiration we were able to give. 
"
Duesseldorf,Human Practices,Visit of Fabian Nienhaus - Karl-von-Frisch Laureate," At the Karl-von-Frisch award ceremony we got to know a high school graduate who was awarded for his excellent achievement in biology. He wrote an outstanding term paper, in which he co-cultivated Bacillus subtilis and the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. One of the hypotheses he offered for the behavior he observed is that the co-cultivation forced one population to produce an antibiotic substance as a defense mechanism.

At the Karl-von-Frisch award ceremony he expressed interest in the iGEM competition and our project. Because he still had numerous questions regarding our co-culturing project after the event, we invited him to visit our university and our lab. That is why Fabian traveled the long way from the Münsterland to Düsseldorf to get more insight into our project. 
In order to give him a tour of our working places and laboratories, we gave him a complete safety instruction, as required by the lab we work in. Armed with a lab coat and safety goggles we explained to him, among others things, general techniques used in laboratory work with nucleic acids and microorganisms and showed him our beautiful cyanobacteria. 
Since our project and his term paper cover closely related topics we had a great discussion about similarities like the use of co-cultivation, but also differences, for example symbiotic vs. combating combinations for co-cultivating.
The time flew by fast and soon Fabian had to start his way home. He will always be welcomed in our lab and we wish him success in his pursuit of a medical degree.


"
Duesseldorf,Integrated Practices,Cyano and Co-culture expert Daniel Ducat," In the beginning of our work with the three “Trinity” organisms we stumbled across several questions: 
How should the growth media be composed? 
How can we effectively use our cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus as a sugar producer? 
How can we prevent the other organisms from overgrowing S. elongatus?

The synthesis of sugars in S. elongatus, especially aiming at a co-culture with heterotrophic organisms, has previously been shown by Dr. Daniel C. Ducat from Michigan State University. His Synechococcus cscB strain produces and exports sucrose in salt stress media. During our brainstorming sessions at the beginning of our iGEM journey, this strain was often named as a main example for the use of cyanobacteria in a co-culture. Finally, we decided to contact Dr. Ducat and asked him for advice and good ideas regarding co-cultures with cyanobacteria. 

Luckily, he was on a symposium visit in Germany in May 2018 and offered to visit us and provide us with the cscB strain. In a private meeting, he suggested to use a sps (sucrose phosphate synthase) overexpressing  Synecchococcus  strain. Thus, we would be able to have sucrose production and export, without having to induce high salt stress in the culture media with NaCl. Although sucrose production would be less effective we could prevent the negative effects of salt stress regarding our heterotrophic bacteria and fungi. 
In one of Dr. Ducat’s publications (A synthetic, light-driven consortium of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria enables stable polyhydroxybutyrate production, 2017), he used barium alginate beads to encapsulate cyanobacteria to enhance sucrose export. We were interested in using these beads as another option for co-culturing methods besides solid and liquid culture. Dr. Ducat provided us with a protocol for creating these beads and suggested to encapsulate all of our “trinity” organisms. 
Most importantly, he suggested M2 as a co-culture medium to us, which is derived from the cyanobacterium medium BG11. He also provided us with the protocols which were then frequently used in our project . 

In summary, Dr. Ducat helped us significantly in several ways that changed our project. At first, by providing us with the Synechococcus cscB strain which enabled us to conduct experiments with sucrose production and export in salt stress media. 
Second, by introducing a co-culture medium to us which we ended up using for all of our co-culturing experiments. 
We are glad to be given the opportunity to speak with a co-culture specialist and value his advice that changed our project significantly.

 "
Duesseldorf,Integrated Practices,Integrated Human Practices with Dr. Spencer Scott," Our work with the quorum sensing system is based on research done by Dr. Spencer Scott and colleagues, who published the paper “A stabilized microbial ecosystem of self-limiting bacteria using synthetic quorum-regulated lysis” in the well known “Nature microbiology” journal in 2017.
Since we knew we would encounter some difficulties and had questions regarding this harsh project, the best choice for us was to reach out to Dr. Scott in order to improve our project. 
At first we presented him our current progress and he showed himself very delighted that his PhD project was further studied by us. He also assured us his support.

Our idea was to use the same microfluidics system that the researchers used in the paper mentioned above. Since the paper does not precisely state which kind of system they used, we asked if their system was easily reproducible in our lab. Unfortunately, Dr. Scott informed us, that their lab was endowed with very sophisticated and costly microfluidics system and advised us against this setup. Instead he suggested us to use a simple chemostat. 
Moreover, he suggested to try to apply the quorum sensing systems in different organisms, since the used parts should, according to him, be transferable to other organisms.
In addition to that, we encountered some issues when comparing the growth situation of the wild type co-culture with the mutant co-culture which included the quorum sensing harbouring microorganisms. He recommended to just check the overgrowth of the specific organisms in the two different situations. 
Regarding this, another important advice he gave us was that a good overall experimental time is 24 hours. 
Finally, to solve the problem of quantifying AHL - the quorum sensing molecule of interest - he proposed to us to use a qualitative approach instead of a quantitative one, hence to try titration of different AHL concentrations and to check the impact it has on our cultures.

When getting to know Dr. Scott, we found out he was a member of the iGEM team Berkeley 2011 which is why he did not only give us significant advice for our project, but also told us about his experience with iGEM, further increasing our enthusiasm for iGEM and the final Giant Jamboree. 
We would like to thank Dr. Scott for this amazing skype interview and the great input he gave our team. We hope - with the gained iGEM experience and future research we will do a great job and one day will also be able to help other iGEM teams and play a role in their interesting projects. 
 "
Duesseldorf,Integrated Practices,Interview with Shraddha Shitut,"
Shraddha Shitut (Sh) is currently working as a postdoc at the Leiden Institute of Biology and institute of Chemistry in the Netherlands. In her PhD she worked on cross-feeding in bacteria resulting in a publication ""Metabolic coupling in bacteria"" in bioRxiv 114462 with which we found many similarities to our subproject ""Auxotrophy"". There she describes the establishment of a co-culture working with unidirectional cross-feeding with amino acids like lysine, histidine and tryptophan. We asked her for advice and wanted her to give an opinion on our approach. 

TD: Hello Shraddha! We are iGEM team Duesseldorf 2018 (TD) and want to know, if you would consider giving us an interview and advice for one of our subprojects. For this year’s project we are working on establishing two- and three-way co-cultures between Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus. One of our approaches is establishing a cross feeding of amino acids between a leucine-auxotroph E. coli and a lysine-auxotroph S. cerevisiae; they are producing the needed amino acid for each other. What is your first impression about our plan? 

Sh: It is an ambitious plan. If we only consider the 2-way interaction between the modified E. coli and BY4742 you need to remember the additional auxotrophy in BY4742 and provide histidine in the medium. This may affect the dependency of the auxotrophic E. coli strain. In my experience in some situations the auxotrophy can be fulfilled even by the presence of other amino acids in the medium. Hence it would be ideal to test of all auxotrophs that are to be used in the project in the presence of the different amino acids to be used in the project. There should be a clear difference here - growth when focal amino acid is provided, no growth when any other amino acid is provided. 

TD: Exactly. Our Auxotrophy system is used in a two way co-culture. We have already added histidine but didn’t consider that it could influence the dependencies. So, thank you for this tip! Why did you start researching auxotrophies and co-cultures?

Sh: I got interested in studying the interactions between bacteria (in a social or community context) during my studies for my masters degree in microbiology. Then I further read about metabolic dependencies in microbial communities and how this possibly affects the percent of bacteria we can cultivate and isolate. It was fascinating to learn how auxotrophies can lead to interactions and networks between microorganisms.  

TD: Interesting! Where can this focus on co-cultures built on auxotrophies lead to in research?

Sh: Auxotrophies can be thought of as the  dependency of an organism on an external source of an essential molecule which in most cases are amino acids, vitamins or nucleotides. These metabolites have to be part of the primary metabolism in a cell and hence essential for growth and proper cell function. A co-culture or interaction based on the exchange of such essential metabolites makes the interaction itself obligatory for the involved partners and hence a good model system to study. Furthermore due to the involvement of the metabolites, especially amino acids, in primary metabolism one can observe direct effects of the interaction (taking place in co-culture) on the behavior of both partners.

TD:  Do you have experiences with amino acid exchange without exporters? 

Sh: The cross-feeding system that I used and studied for my PhD did not inherently contain mutations in any of the amino acid exporters. We observed exchange of amino acids via physical structures connecting cells. However we cannot completely rule out the involvement of exporters as a response to amino acid starvation.

TD: In your publication it is mentioned that the exchange took place via nanotubes. Did you modify your cells for this? And if yes, how? 

Sh: We used a synthetically engineered cross-feeding system wherein we introduced two mutations in wildtype E. coli cells namely an auxotrophy and an over-production. We observed the formation of nanotubes in co-cultures where one partner was auxotrophic for an amino acid. We did not introduce any specific mutation that enabled the formation of nanotubes.

TD: We are working with a lysine auxotrophic system. Can you explain why lysine, histidine and tryptophan are good candidates to work with ? Why are they so often in focus of studies? 

Sh: Lysine, histidine and tryptophan are usually selected for their isolated biosynthetic pathways which allows for easy manipulation without affecting the production of other amino acids. 

TD: What were the challenges you faced and what do you think could be challenges with our approach? 

Sh: The first challenge of your project is to introduce the auxotrophies and amino acid production/secretion mutations in the different partners. The second would be to ensure that the produced amino acids are sufficient to support growth (Keep in that due to the fact that the partners belong to different classes their amino acid requirement levels will likely be different). The third challenge is to successfully cultivate the 3 organisms such that each partner remains stable over a time period long enough for you to study the interaction. Here you need to take into consideration differences in growth rates, nutritional requirements, ambient pH and so forth for the 3 organisms.

TD: What methods did you use to quantify your amino acid production? 

Sh: I used both an indirect biosensor based approach and a chemical analysis technique (LC-MS) for quantifying amino acid production. 

TD: What method would you suggest if we want  to extract amino acids from the cells?

Sh: Internal amino acid extraction requires two main steps - breaking open the cell and purifying the amino acids within. The cell wall and membrane can be disrupted either by physical techniques (sonication, heat, beads) or by chemical techniques (lysozyme). The choice of techniques is dependent on factors like equipment availability in the lab, number of samples to be purified at a given time, characteristics of the cell (i.e. cell wall thickness) and so on. The second step of purifying the amino acids from the cell extract also differs based on which amino acids are of interest (free amino acids, protein bound amino acids). 
       The method I used in my study was based on a physical disruption of E. coli cells using heat and sonication followed by solvent based extraction of internal free amino acids. This method is useful for extraction of internal amino acids from numerous and multiple samples.

TD: Did you also measure the composition of your cultivation media to know how much of the produced amino acids are exported? If you did, can you suggest a method to use here as well? 

Sh: I was using minimal media for all my experiments and during the chemical analysis of my samples for amino acid quantification I always used asterile control media. This was especially important because minimal media contains ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source and the NH-group here interferes with LC-MS measurements. More specifically because we were derivatizing (using FMOC to basically label the amino groups to make it detectable in the machine) the samples prior to amino acid quantification and we had to add excess reagent to first nullify the NH-groups already present in blank minimal media.

TD: We are working on a co-culture with different organism classes. Did you use organisms other than E. coli and what are your experiences?

Sh: We used Acinetobacter baylyi in the cross-feeder co-cultures with E. coli. A. baylyi is a gram negative soil dwelling bacteria hence not very different from E. coli in terms of amino acid biosynthetic pathways and lab cultivation. It was however tricky to introduce the auxotrophic and over-production mutations in A. baylyi as compared to E. coli. This (genetic manipulation) I think is the biggest hurdle in organisms that are less established than E. Coli, followed by finding the right media that supports the growth of all partners. 

TD: What do you think are the advantages of co-cultures and co-cultivation in general? 

Sh: I think co-culture and co-cultivation approaches can give us a lot more information about bacterial behavior than isolation based techniques. By culturing bacteria with other organisms we introduce a factor in its environment that can result in a number of reactions or interactions, both positive and negative. Hence such techniques can lead to novel compounds being produced by the involved bacteria. 

TD: Thank you very much, for your precious advice and time. You helped us a lot! 
"
Duesseldorf,Public Engagement,Lecture Series," The iGEM competition is primarily about research, but public relations work is also a very large component. 
The biggest problem of synthetic biology is that even though it is a big player on the market, it seems like only a drop of information has leaked to the public. 
This lack of knowledge leads to fears on all sides. Society seems to be mainly aware of possible risks and over the top doomsday scenarios that probably originated from genetic engineering discussions going south and overblown and over budgeted Hollywood movies. However, scientists fear the restriction their work will suffer due to new regulations that might be implemented.
We think that an open and fact-based discussion can be very helpful for this issue. By educating the public, the advantages synthetic biology could bring can be shown to them. Also, there are a lot of things that still need to be discussed like the improvement of security and safety of the environment. 

Therefore, we have made it our mission to inform everyone who is willing to learn about the topic of synthetic life sciences and genetic engineering. With a total of 4 lectures the topic was critically questioned and illuminated from different perspectives. Our goal was to sensitize the population to important and topical issues and help them to distinguish between truth and lies. 
At the beginning of each lecture, we captured the general mood about the upcoming aspect of synthetic biology with a few questions. After the lecture, we asked the same questions again to analyze whether the lecture changed the opinion of the audience. The first lecture was presented by our advisor Tim Blomeier and offered the audience a good overview of the field of synthetic biology.
  On June 5  Nicolas Schmelling, also one of our advisors, dealt with the various fields of application of genetic engineering in agriculture in more detail. He compared conventional breeding with genetic engineering methods used today and clarified the various definitions of synthetic biology, genetic engineering and breeding. The third lecture was given by Dr. Christian Dumpitak and was titled in german: “Ich mach mir die Welt widdewidde wie sie mir gefällt.!? ...und was ELSA dazu sagt: Perspektiven auf Synthetische Lebenswissenschaften”. Dr. Dumpitak started his lecture by discussing aspects of the short movie  “Who are the engineers of the future?” by Christina Agapakis & Patrik Boyle (Ginkgo Bioworks), USA 2010. After a short discussion, he gave us an introduction to the history of genetic engineering, its legal regulations and how it can be distinguished from synthetic life sciences. “ELSA” (or “ELSI”) stands for “Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects (or Implications)“ and is a concomitant research in modern life sciences. In the light of ELSA, he discussed potentials, risks and ethical views on synthetic life sciences.
  The last lecture on 03.07. was given by our PI Dr. Ilka Axmann. She focused on genetic engineering methods that are currently used in microbiology. Her talk started with simple information about synthetic biology to help build a basic understanding. After that the newly obtained knowledge was applied to everyday objects, where the audience - with some help of PI Ilka Axmann - had to guess just how much genetic engineering has already influenced everyday life. 

For us it is very important to give all interested people the chance to think about all possible aspects of synthetic life sciences. In this context it was a desire for us to be available for all questions after each presentation. Offering pizza and beverages many listeners came to us with interesting questions and discussion topics, which we had fun talking about in a small group.
The results of our surveys show that there are still some concerns and prejudices against synthetic life sciences among the population. Some listeners were surprised and sometimes shocked as to which methods can be used in today's agriculture and which safe methods are prohibited due to ethical concerns. As feedback it was often a relief to know more about the topic and to understand the background better. 
"
Duesseldorf,Public Engagement,Survey," Furthermore, we surveyed the listeners before and after each lecture in order to get a general overview of the opinion on synthetic biology. As can be seen from Fig. 1, 84% of the participants have regularly dealt with synthetic biology previously, 16% have dealt with it only now and then and none of the audience have never dealt with it at all. 
It becomes clear that our lecture series initially addressed only people who have dealt with the topic before, so it can be assumed that they are no strangers to the topic.  
However, 50% of participants thought that synthetic biology has little or no impact on our daily lives (Figure 2). A balance arises in this question though as the other 50% of respondents disagree and are of the opinion that synthetic biology does have an impact on our everyday lives. 
One of the most interesting questions asked how much synthetic biology will change our lives has also been answered very interestingly (Figure 4), and it is particularly noteworthy that 31% have a negative view of establishing newly developed products or processes. For our lecture series this means that we not only had supporters in the audience, but also critics.   
In the end it was asked if the participants will now deal more with the topic. More than 67% believe that they will continue to do so on a regular basis and 33% will do so more often (Figure 2).
"
Duesseldorf,Public Engagement,Giving Everybody a Chance," It is very important for us to give everyone the chance to take a look at the synthetic life sciences and perhaps inspire them to dive deep into the field. We believe that science should be freely accessible to everyone. Everybody should be able to expand their knowledge and expertise and should have the chance to contribute to their favored scientific discipline, regardless of their financial background or country of origin. 
Since this vision is not yet reality, we tried to contribute a small part to this enormous challenge. The Heinrich Heine University offers many programs for refugees who are currently not able to access science. We turned to participants of German courses and the so-called ""Sprachbuddy"" program and invited them for a discussion and experiment session. 
In a comfortably sized group with people from Syria and Iran, we started out by giving a rough overview of the synthetic life sciences and introducing them to the iGEM competition in German. We were impressed by their language skills as all of them already spoke and understood German quite well. We only had to explain a few key words. 
Our guests expressed great interest and many questions came up, which we answered with pleasure. After the discussion a small but interesting experiment followed. With normal household utensils we extracted DNA from a pepper. Everyone was amazed when they saw the extracted DNA in front of their eyes and even we, who work with DNA every day, were impressed.
In the end we gave a tour through our laboratories. All the unknown equipment and samples in the incubators looked very strange to them at first, but after some explanations everyone was excited to learn more. The light cabinets in which we cultivate the cyanobacteria found a lot of admiration. 
All in all, not only did our guests learn a lot from us but we also learned from them. They were highly motivated to continue their work or their studies after coming to Germany. We are very happy to be able to give them an insight into our work and wish them the best of luck for their future.

"
Duesseldorf,Public Engagement,Heine meets Huxley," On July 16 we took part in the first event of  “Heine meets Huxley” - a project brought into the world by the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf based on the dystopian novel “Brave New World” written by Aldous Huxley. 
During the introductional event “Brave New World - cloned babies and super plants” aspects of genetic engineering were introduced and discussed which was a great opportunity for us to educate people about iGEM, synthetic biology and to still unfounded fears. 

In his novel Huxley describes an dystopian world in 2540, where cloned babies are being genetically modified and assigned into classes based on their intelligence and labor. 
Written in 1931 and published a year after, Huxley expected huge scientific advances in future society but also a large number of sinister applications for them. 
Already in the first chapter - which was read out to the filled room - we were introduced to a world of artificial wombs, excessive cloning and the manipulation of intelligence through different oxygen concentrations given to fetuses determining their future social class. A quite disturbing beginning. 
The first talk given by Prof. Dr. Maria von Korff Schmising underlined different methods of genetic modifications used in plants and the effects - a bigger variety in foods - on the market. 
After that Prof. Dr. Jan-Steffen Krüssel explained how  in vitro  fertilization works nowadays and gave information about where Huxley had been wrong: For example, using less oxygen is not correlated with lesser intelligence but rather a natural environment in the oviduct of women. 
  Next, it was our turn. We prepared information booths on four topics: green biotechnology - the genetic manipulation of plants; red biotechnology - advances in medical fields through synthetic biology; white biotechnology - genetic engineering used in the bio industry and CRISPR/Cas - a new technique in genetic engineering.
At each booth we arranged an informational video and a quiz about each topic to test our visitors’ knowledge about each topic. 
After realizing that they often had no idea what products are made by genetically modified organisms, people were shown everyday examples, such as detergents with enzymes, foods with added protein and vitamins produced by microorganisms, to demonstrate the importance of synthetic biology in our everyday life. The spectators often weren’t aware and were surprised they had been using products of genetically engineered bacteria all along!
We also gave them several items for comparison, such as rennet cheese with naturally and synthetically produced enzymes, to let visitors decide which they liked best. Surprise: they liked both.
The green biotechnology booth introduced the people to the concept of Golden rice in comparison to normal rice. 
For the red biotechnology booth we showed an exhibit of a pig pancreas and were able to explain that this had been used for insulin production a long time ago, whereas the production nowadays is a lot faster and less cruel. The visitors were relieved that the amount of animals we raised for medical purposes had been reduced by such technologies.  In the end one question stood out: “Why do you think the society is afraid of genetic engineering and synthetic biology even though there are so many advantages?”
We realized this fear usually develops from the lack of information about procedures, methods, laws and utilizations. 
When given those information, a lot of sceptical people suddenly began to understand the advantages of synthetic biology and started to abandon unrealistic fears.
 "
Duesseldorf,Public Engagement,´March for Science´ Cologne," On the 22nd April of 2018 our team participated in the ´March for Science Germany´ in Cologne. 
Every year hundreds of thousands of people worldwide demonstrate for free and unrepressed scientific research as well as evidence based policy. It is also used as a way to communicate with the public which otherwise has little to no contact to science in general. This interaction is important though in order to create a positive picture of science in the public.

Our team met at the Domplatte in Cologne at 11 am and together with the iGEM teams from Bielefeld, Bonn and Aachen as well as hundreds of other (non-iGEM) participants marched 2 kilometres (1.24 miles) downtown to the Rudolfsplatz. On the way there several interested people stopped and listened to our slogans for free science.
At the Rudolfsplatz a lot of speeches and talks from a variety of journalists, physicists and biologists, like Ranga Yogeshwar and Mark Benecke were given. We discussed fakes news and biased data of governmental proclamations as well as the repression of scientific work. An additional important aspect was the responsibility of the scientific community in representing themselves to the general public. Therefore the work of science journalists is very important for public relations. Some of the speeches picked out the working conditions of German scientists regarding permanent employment and resulting problems in life balance and family planning.
The speeches at the event were very informative and showed how important it is to be well received by the public. This event was the reason why our team decided to put more effort into public relations.

ECUST,HUMAN PRACTICE,Overview,"“Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects the work.” (Peter Carr, Director of Judging) is the comment which gives a clear definition of all Human Practices activities. Therefore, we tried to answer two questions: how can synthetic biology affect the world? And in which way can the world affect Iron Guardian? To answer the former one, we chose to collaborate with different teams and thought the issues we are working on vary from team to team, we all wish and try to utilize what we learn to solve practical problems and make the world a better one. What’s more, we integrated the social influence into our project to answer the latter question. With communication, economic benefit and responsibility as our important focus, we interviewed professors and employees in related industry, and showcased the great economic benefit of our project. By distributing questionnaire and analyzing the data acquired, we managed to explain and improve our project according to the public concerns and suggestions. The new concept of “3+ net” raised by ECUST will also help all teams to create, to reflect, and to improve."
ECUST,INTEGRATED HUMAN  PRACTICE,Introduction,"""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" — Peter Carr, Director of Judging.If we would like to know how our work affects the world, we will have to LOOK outside. But if we would like to know how the world affects our work, we will also have to STEP outside. Since our project focuses on solving practical environmental issues, besides wet-lab experiments, it is of vital significance for us to integrate the opinions of stakeholders and public citizens into our project. This year, with COMMUNICATION, ECONOMIC BENEFITS and RESPONSIBILITY as the cores of our integrated human practices, we tried to shape and improve our project in a more comprehensive way. For example, through interviews with professors and company employees, we got a clearer view of the project orientation, and the feedback of a Petrochemical Corporation gave us inspiration to improve our hardware. The practical situation and problems caused by biofilm and rust promotes us to find out the most serious aspect of this issue, which turns out to be whether one method can produce economic benefits, or has the potential of doing so. What’s more, the questionnaire we distributed gave us insight into the public concerns and suggestions.
"
ECUST,INTEGRATED HUMAN  PRACTICE,Integration in the project,"Integrated Human Practices showcases how the world can affect your work, but before the world can have any effect on our project, the very first thing we should do is to hear what the world is saying, that is why we paid special attention to communication, both internal and external. The internal communication with our team members and other teams under the same track, the external communication with experts in different fields and workers in related industries, and the data we collected via reports, literature and field research, all pointed to two important aspects of our project, the improvement of hardware and the economic benefit.During the experience interviewing and collaborating with a Petrochemical Corporation, we displayed our hardware and software, which was able to predict corrosive degree based on neural network configuration. After discussing with the workers and knowing more about their practical needs, we found that, apart from predicting the proper time to drop the bacteria, to monitor the water quality with parameters such as dissolved oxygen or pH was also an important part for factory. So we adjusted the hardware design, added 4 sensors (Industrial pH sensor, ORP Sensor, Electrical Conductivity Sensor and Temperature Sensor) to collect related data, and modified the software interface to match the new design of our hardware.“It is not our ultimate goal to create something, but to make it truly useful and practical.” — Iron Guardian Besides, based on the data we collected, we found that one of the most important issues caused by biofilm and rust in cooling water loop was the exceedingly high usage of water, chemical and energy. Take power plant as an example, the bio-fouling and rust may lead to lower efficiency, higher temperature, more expense on operation and maintenance and so on. By applying bio-control approach for one year, we can get a 56% reduction of water assumption, or 40 million gallons, a temperature drop of 6~7 Celsius degrees, 31,000 pounds of chemicals saved, 10% increase in power plant load, or 20 megawatts, and overall savings of 34 million dollars for just one power plant. Not to mention the design can also be applied to industries such as semiconductor, agriculture, oil refineries and so forth, during which our project will present the great potential of economic benefit. What’s more, ECUST didn’t forget to take responsibility into consideration. We conducted a survey on public opinions about bioremediation, tried to explain our project and adjust our design according to public concern.  "
ECUST,EDUCATION & PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT,Summer camp,"During this summer vacation, we participated in summer camp activity in ECUST and gave a presentation on synthetic biology and our project to high school students."
ECUST,EDUCATION & PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT,Lectures,We were invited to hold biological lecture for students in our department to show specifically what you can do in producing through synthetic biology.
ECUST,EDUCATION & PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT,Club night,"For new students eager to know our team, we gave a presentation about our iGEM club and project to freshmen on the Club Night, welcoming their registration."
ECUST,EDUCATION & PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT,Questionnaire,"In order to make our project more complete and integrated, we always have to know how the public citizens without professional background think about our project. To collect public opinions on solving practical environmental problems with genetically engineered bacteria, we designed a questionnaire and distributed it across the country. With more than 500 valid questionnaires, we found most respondents (57.48%) strongly supported to bring in a third-party organization for supervising and controlling, but also 66.22% of all respondents found it risky to put engineered bacteria even with well-designed hardware and equipment. We hope the survey can help us have a deeper understanding of public opinions and by analyzing and interpreting related results, we improved our project with a clear target. Results of some important results are listed as follows and the full file can be found here."
Goettingen,Human Practices,Take a look at our Slideshow! ,"We have collected a lot of pictures along our way through the iGEM project and visualized them within a slideshow: If you want to get a sneak peak into some of our events, feel free to watch through it. Specific and much more detailed entries to each date can be found below- here you will also find continuative links to specific topics, to enhance your knowledge."
Goettingen,Human Practices,"Panel Discussion: Fritz Günzler: „Glyphosat – Wundermittel oder gefährliches Pflanzengift?""","Early on in our project we tried to find a suitable topic: Out of our brainstorming, glyphosate was one of the most promising candidates we wanted to work with. To receive additional information about the herbicide, to acquire an overview over the opinion of the general public as well as politicians and to get an overview of the magnitude of the controversial discussion, we participated in a public panel discussion hosted by the politician Fritz Günzler, named Glyphosate – miracle cure or dangerous plant toxin? Soon it became apparent, that this question is not easily answered, and a heated discussion arose between politicians and the audience.

                  On the one hand, farmers rely on the very efficient herbicide to produce sufficient amounts of food, while on the other hand, the long-term effects of glyphosate are poorly understood and cause harm to biodiversity. Studies that dealt with the cancerogenity of glyphosate towards humans came to no clear conclusion, leaving a big uncertainty behind. We soon realized, that due to this heated climate in the community, more independent research on the topic is necessary and we prompt decided that this was going to be our topic of choice. If you want to know more about the scientific background of glyphosate follow the link to our Background page. Here you can find out more about glyphosates modes of action and potential ways to achieve a resistance to the total-herbicide."
Goettingen,Human Practices,Bringing our project to young students,"One of the most important things in science is its educational aspect. Therefore we aim to stay in constant touch with the public, to inform everyone about our project. In this way we receive constant feedback, which we try to directly implement into our project design. We especially want to raise awareness in young children to involve them in research and wake their passion for science early on in life. Therefore, our team member Veronika went to the Staatliche Chiemsee Realschule to present our project to young students and show them the everyday life of scientists. At this point, we already realized that even though Glyphosate is such a prominent topic in the media, the public and especially young people lack a certain, objective and scientific background. Informing the public in an objective and scientific way is one issue that we want to tackle during our project."
Goettingen,Human Practices,International March for Science 2018 ,"The march of Science is an international mass rally to promote the value of research and science and to demonstrate against ""alternative facts”. We felt obliged to take part as the herbicide glyphosate is hugely discussed in the media and several studies were shown to be incorrect or poorly carried out.  If you want to know what studies and newspaper have to say about the glyphosate controversy, use the following links in order to create your own opinion towards the controversial topic: Spiegel online 2015 ; ZEIT online 2016.
                       Different representatives from the fields science, politics and society debated and allowed the audience to participate in the discussion. Events like this help to raise attention for current research topics just like ours and cast a positive light on science as a whole. So please check the next March for Science to be part of the movement yourself! "
Goettingen,Human Practices,Meeting with the minister for agriculture,"The minister for agriculture of lower saxony Barbara Otte-Kinast gave a presentation about glyphosate and other issues in agriculture at our University. She presented the advantages and disadvantages of using glyphosate in agriculture and its status in society. During the presentation she gave a lot of room for discussions with the audience.
                      We were very lucky to be able to talk to her about our project after the presentation. She let us know that working on glyphosate and to produce a rapid test allowing its fast determination is an important step, necessary in the current discussion. "
Goettingen,Human Practices,Microbe Slam at the VAAM annual conference ,"One of our team members had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Annual Conference 2018 of the Association for General and Applied Microbiology (VAAM). The VAAM consists of approximately 3500 microbiology-oriented scientists and aims to improve the exchange of information and research. 
It was a very nice chance for our team member Janek to be part of such a big convention for the first time in his life (right picture). He got insights into how well-organized projects are constructed from the beginning to the end and was able to talk to scientists from all over the country to discuss our project and plan a successful outcome. As a lot of companies were also present on the conference, we were also able to establish supporting connections with Eppendorf and Biozym. The products provided by them will benefit us big time as our project improves further and further.We are all very proud that Janek also participated in this year’s Microbe Slam, where he presented our topic in a fun and extraordinary way and competed against four different young scientists. The participation at the Slam was later recognized in an article of the BIOspektrum magazine (left picture). We are happy to make an impact in the scientific journals and hope to repeat this, as the project progresses. In this way we are able to reach out to the public and generate interest for our project.Interested in the presentation? You can follow the link to watch the whole performance and leave some feedback on our Facebook channel: Microbe Slam. "
Goettingen,Human Practices,Bier & Brezeln (= beer & pretzel),"Two of our team members presented our project at the Bier & Brezeln event organized by the Fachschaft (student representatives) of Biology of the University of Göttingen. This is a platform that allows to spread research in an interdisciplinary way. It was a huge success as students from diverse departments of the university led an interesting discussion and gave us a lot of input for the further course of our project.

                          "
Goettingen,Human Practices, Masters information day ,"We were very busy this weekend. While two of our members went to the German iGEM Meetup in Marburg we presented our poster and work to the new Master students of the Molecular Lifesciences: Microbiology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology and Developmental Biology study program of our University. Through that we inspired the upcoming generation to take part in next years iGEM competition and tought them ways to adress crucial problems to make the world a better place, using synthetic biology."
Goettingen,Human Practices,Marburg Meetup,"Staying in touch with the projects of other iGEM teams is important to acquire an overview over the own progress. Therefore, we attended the German iGEM Meetup in Marburg from the 22nd till the 24th of June. Here, we had the opportunity to present our poster to other iGEM teams and thus collect ideas to improve our research process. (right picture)
                          We also looked out to collaborate with the other teams: Specifically, the team of Marburg itself will help us with the protein characterization of the EPSP Synthase, the main target of Glyphosate. Apart from the scientific exchange, we were also able to take a look around the city and form new friendships at the camping site that was well organized by the iGEM Team Marburg (left picture).
                          All in all, the Meetup helped us to take home a big chunk of motivation and a new collaboration partner. A big thank you to the iGEM Team Marburg, which organized this Meetup and took brilliant care of all the participants."
Goettingen,Human Practices,Interactive Information Booth ,"Most people would agree that there is too much unfiltered material about glyphosate on the internet. Hence, we wanted to directly talk to the public to check on their state of knowledge and what they really know and think about glyphosate. Therefore, we packed our poster, together with some props and survey sheets and travelled to the Gänseliesel in the heart of Göttingen to uncover the opinion, knowledge and wishes of the people. This booth might seem small but there were several things to discover. For once, of course, the poster, that helped us to explain who we are and what we do. It also showed the current status of our project.
                             A general concern about glyphosate is its impact on biodiversity in the soil. Since glyphosate was first introduced as an antibiotic, its accumulation in the soil may also influence the biodiversity of bacteria. There are approximately between 100 million and 1 billion bacteria found in a teaspoon of productive soil. These Soil Bacteria have a diverse set of skills, which allows them to act as one of the greatest “real-life” influencers on earth. However, most of the visitors had only a narrow idea about what microorganisms are, what they do and where to find them. To illustrate and exemplify with how many different microbes glyphosate may interfere in the soil, visitors could participate in a small experiment, where they could leave their microbial fingerprint on a BHI agar plate. To check the microbial diversity on the hand of each participant we incubated the plates at 37°C over the weekend and published the results on our Facebook page in the folder ""Infostand Göttingen"". Check out whats on your hand that you can’t see! Small hint: washing your hands with soap for at least 30 seconds helps to fight against infection! You want to know how to properly wash your hands. "
Goettingen,Human Practices,Panel discussion - Glyphosat zum Salat?! - Chancen und Risiken des Herbizids,"During our human practice events we realized that most people do not have enough information about the herbicide glyphosate but are very interested in getting to know more about the topic. Therefore our iGEM Team invited to a panel discussion with the topic “Glyphosate on my plate?-Chances and risks of the herbicide” on the 12th of July in the Adam-von-Trott-Saal of the old Mensa in Göttingen which had the perfect ambience to discuss this controversial topic.The event started with an introduction of our project by our team member Jonas in order to inform the very diverse audience about the iGEM competition, why we are participating, about what glyphosate is, the current state of the research and of course about our project and aim to find a solution to this controversially discussed herbicide.Afterwards Robert and Marie of our team introduced our four guests (from left to right) Horst-Henning Steinmann of the centre for Biodiversity in Göttingen, Werner Wille of the “CDU” of Göttingen, Achim Hübner of the “Landvolk Niedersachsen” and Harald Wiedemann of “die Grünen” of Göttingen.The panel started the discussion about the wide application of glyphosate in the agricultural areas of and around Göttingen. Lower Saxony, which Göttingen is part of, is known as the number one state of Germanys agriculture and produces for example almost half of the total german potato yield.Harald Wiedemann expressed his severe concerns about the biodiversity and the extinction of specific species due to the use of glyphosate and other herbicides. He and his party are also part of the initiative „Stopp Glyphosat“ to reduce the use of a herbicide which long-term effects are not known yet.Achim Hübner however pointed out that the use of glyphosate is essential in order to guarantee the high amount of yield and the low prices of food in the supermarkets. In addition, he said that we never know all the side effects of the substances that we consume and therefore one cannot forbid only one specific herbicide on speculations.When our team members asked about an alternative for glyphosate Horst-Henning Steinmann stated that the current alternative to glyphosate are non-chemical methods such as ploughing, this however is more expensive and takes more time. He also said that glyphosate is the cheapest and most effective herbicide available at the moment and pointed out that the side effects of alternative herbicides are also not known yet. However he is also in favour of the reduction of the wide use of glyphosate especially in area where it is not a 100% necessary. Werner Wille agreed with the point of view of Achim Hübner and would see the act of forbidding glyphosate as populist. After the very diverse and motivated discussion of our guest the audience also asked a few questions. This was very interesting because it was a very versatile audience of students of agriculture, members of the BUND Göttingen and even farmer of farms close to Göttingen. In the end it can be said that even though the panel discussion lasted for one and a half hours there is still much more to talk and discuss about.The result so far was that there is no alternative at the moment, especially when the people are not willing to pay more for their food in the supermarket, even though the impact of glyphosate on the biodiversity could be severe. All in all the panel discussion was a huge success and we thank all of the participants for coming!"
Goettingen,Human Practices,Participating in the third Synthetic Biology conference in Landshut," Synthetic biology is constantly evolving, as new research topics revolutionize the way we look at natural sciences. From newly-found approaches in artificial photosynthesis to finding out, which genes are necessarily required to enable an organism to live, the Third conference for Synthetic Biology in Landshut gave us stunning insights into various areas of research. Of course, we didn't miss the opportunity to present our own project to the fellow scientists, using our poster (right picture) and a presentation (left picture). We were specifically happy to get to know the projects of former iGEM teams, as their presentations will serve us as great inspiration for our own presentation at the Giant Jamboree. The conversation with other iGEM teams from this year motivated us further as the iGEM thought was constantly present at the conference. All in all we are very thankful that we were able to participate in this well organized conference and visit Germanys biggest federal state Bavaria.  We also took a group photo with all participants of the convention, maybe you can spot every team member (not everyone is wearing the iconic yellow shirt). This picture also occurred in the BioSpektrum journal with a connection to the VAAM, which we know already quite well. We are happy to take part in the research of synthetic biology topics and hope to visit a similar conference soon again in the future. "
Goettingen,Human Practices,Influencing the young minds faster than bacteria,"Goettingen offers many possibilities for young scientists to enhance their lab skills and work together as a team. One of these is the XLAB where young students in the age of 17-22 have the opportunity to come together for a month and work in groups on current scientific topics. The future scientists pick up new lab skills and discuss issues, while exchanging their knowledge. This reminded us of our own iGEM project. We took the opportunity to present our topic and get in touch with the students and supervisors to gain some extra opinions on our progress."
Goettingen,Human Practices,Publication in the BIOspektrum,"We had the exciting oppertunity to introduce our project to the public by publishing a short article in the Biospektrum journal. With that we not only gave further insights into our project, but we also expanded our audience from the general public to other scientists all over the country, gaining more and more publicity. This underlines that our topic is of enormous relevance particularly in the science community. We are even present on Researchgate as an official scientific team! This helps us big time in the progression of our careers.

Therefore our iGEM Team invited to a panel discussion with the topic “Glyphosate on my plate?-Chances and risks of the herbicide” on the 12th of July in the Adam-von-Trott-Saal of the old Mensa in Göttingen which had the perfect ambience to discuss this controversial topic.The event started with an introduction of our project by our team member Jonas in order to inform the very diverse audience about the iGEM competition, why we are participating, about what glyphosate is, the current state of the research and of course about our project and aim to find a solution to this controversially discussed herbicide.Afterwards Robert and Marie of our team introduced our four guests (from left to right) Horst-Henning Steinmann of the centre for Biodiversity in Göttingen, Werner Wille of the “CDU” of Göttingen, Achim Hübner of the “Landvolk Niedersachsen” and Harald Wiedemann of “die Grünen” of Göttingen.The panel started the discussion about the wide application of glyphosate in the agricultural areas of and around Göttingen. Lower Saxony, which Göttingen is part of, is known as the number one state of Germanys agriculture and produces for example almost half of the total german potato yield.Harald Wiedemann expressed his severe concerns about the biodiversity and the extinction of specific species due to the use of glyphosate and other herbicides. He and his party are also part of the initiative „Stopp Glyphosat“ to reduce the use of a herbicide which long-term effects are not known yet.Achim Hübner however pointed out that the use of glyphosate is essential in order to guarantee the high amount of yield and the low prices of food in the supermarkets. In addition, he said that we never know all the side effects of the substances that we consume and therefore one cannot forbid only one specific herbicide on spec.When our team members asked about an alternative for glyphosate Horst-Henning Steinmann stated that the current alternative to glyphosate are non-chemical methods such as ploughing, this however is more expensive and takes more time. He also said that glyphosate is the cheapest and most effective herbicide available at the moment and pointed out that the side effects of alternative herbicides are also not known yet. However he is also in favour of the reduction of the wide use of glyphosate especially in area where it is not a 100% necessary. Werner Wille agreed with the point of view of Achim Hübner and would see the act of forbidding glyphosate as populist. After the very diverse and motivated discussion of our guest the audience also asked a few questions. This was very interesting because it was a very versatile audience of students of agriculture, members of the BUND Göttingen and even farmer of farms close to Göttingen. In the end it can be said that even though the panel discussion lasted for one and a half hours there is still much more to talk and discuss about.The result so far was that there is no alternative at the moment, especially when the people are not willing to pay more for their food in the supermarket, even though the impact of glyphosate on the biodiversity could be severe. All in all the panel discussion was a huge success and we thank all of the participants for coming!"
Goettingen,Education & Engagement,Influencing the young minds faster than bacteria,"Goettingen offers many possibilities for young scientists to enhance their lab skills and work together as a team. One of these is the XLAB where young students in the age of 17-22 have the opportunity to come together for a month and work in groups on current scientific topics. The future scientists pick up new lab skills and discuss issues, while exchanging their knowledge. This reminded us of our own iGEM project. We took the opportunity to present our topic and get in touch with the students and supervisors to gain some extra opinions on our progress."

GreatBay China,Integrated HP,"To remove this liability and improve safety factors, we finalized our cat-attracting system as a bottle of extracted essential oil and a fan to spread the odor that obviously increases the safety and ethical factor."," Safety issues have always been our first consideration; since we were, then, planning to use a plate with living organisms in, the device must be constructed deliberately and safely to prevent any leak possible. One of our public engagement presented the answer to us. On July 6th, our first presentation, also being our first event facing the public, took place at X.factor. This presentation, free in the boundary of age, background, or academic level, had brought us waves of brand new ideas that all enlightens us with revolutionary designs. Yet one of them, coming from a university student majoring in psychology, remained distinctively important and profoundly impactive:"
GreatBay China,Integrated HP,GBC Documentary P3,But what about the safety concerns? Please check the next episode. The previous episode is about connecting out lab project to stray cat rescue.
GreatBay China,Integrated HP,Conclusion,"Having conducted all these research listed above, we can draw some conclusions.First of all, a hardware like “the Kitty Wonderland” is something very needed by the animal rescue teams. From dedicated individuals to animal protection association officials, the same problems of high alertness of the feral cats preventing the effective execution of street animal managing measures like TNR kept being reported. And it was the very key impeding the rescuing of feral cats. However, the incorporation of synthetic biology into such a hardware requires careful and sensible design, in which biosafety was the top concern. People are worried by the fact that genetically engineered microorganisms would be placed somewhere outside the laboratory. So we were then aware that in real application scenarios, even if we are to use nepetalactol produced by microbes, we could only use the aseptic nepetalactol extraction produced. Moreover, since the hardware is to be placed in the public area, a number of other designs for practicability are also needed. We have to make the hardware durable in all kinds of environment, and appealing for cats. We must also pay attention to how to prevent vandalism towards the cat shelter, which is to be achieved by public education on respecting and caring for animals.The government has either encouraged nor discouraged the placement of cat shelter, but we were informed that whether we could actually place the cat shelter in the future is dependent on the opinions of individual management. So far, all managements we inquired have supported this idea. We are also aware through conversations with multiple organizations including iGEM HQ and Safety Committee that at this moment we are not yet prepared to conduct the animal experiment. So we followed this instruction and have not performed any test using cat attractants like catnip."
GreatBay China,Public Engagement,"SynBio, Cats and ChangeMakers","We gave a bilingual talk named ‘SynBio, Cats and ChangeMakers’ at 
    x.factory
   on synthetic biology and its application, introducing our iGEM project in specific as one example of what synbio was capable of doing. Then we discussed our ultimate scheme of building a street cat shelter with biosynthesized nepetalactone as attractant that could aid volunteers in helping feral cats. (See Applied Design for the development of our design.)

Our audiences include students, neighborhood committee members, engineers, designers, artists and investors, who demonstrated great curiosity at the field of synthetic biology and engaged enthusiastically in discussions concerning synbio and our project after the talk. We had audiences who inquire about the possibility of initiating their own synbio project at the maker space or at home, so we gladly filled in knowledge about biosafety lab requirements we had, shamefully, missed out a bit on during the talk. Some asked in details how we found the desire pathway of biosynthesizing nepetalactol and whether computer simulation could aid the design, and we offered several databases that might be of help. Though we must admit due to lack of sufficient knowledge in computational tools, we were unable to explore further concerning the latter question. Afterwards, many participants demanded us to tell them more interesting iGEM projects, which we shared with delight.
During this experience, we noticed how starting with innovative iGEM projects and the application of synbio can help engage audiences before we filled them with the engineering principle behind. However, it was necessary to discuss biosafety and bioethics, especially facing listeners who enjoy creation.

More offered keen advice on the Kitty Wonderland prototype, such as how volunteers could supervise the shelter and how the shelter might be able to alert volunteers when several cats are present, so volunteers can come, feed or trap cats for neutering and vaccination. "
GreatBay China,Public Engagement,"Discussions with animal-welfare groups, neighborhood and local government on the applied design of our project","Our applied design, the cat shelter, aims to help volunteers who care about the welfare of feral cats. So aside from engaging with Fenghua Li’s volunteer group in the first place, we also participated in an event advocating civilized rules for pet keeping, in which we interviewed participants, who were considering adopting pets, about their opinions on a cat shelter using nepetalactone as attractant being placed in their neighborhood. They pointed out we could organize residents who fed feral cats occasionally to manage the shelter through connecting with neighborhood committees. Aside, some said their neighbors might not want feral cats gathering near their residents, so we needed to consider where the house should be placed cautiously.

GreatBay China,Public Engagement,Innovative engagement through arts at Maker Faire,"With the prototype of Kitty Wonderland, we exhibited at an international Maker Faire, in which we introduced our synbio and our project to viewers based on previous content at x.factory and asked them to decorate the wooden cat shelter by drawing elements such as cats, E.coli, yeast, pipettes and structural formula of DNA and nepetalactol.
 
 Following the successful demonstration at the faire, we intend the wonderland and synthetic biology to children in school, teaching them basic concepts of synthetic biology and raising their awareness on the problem of stray cats. Afterwards, children can decorate the wonderland with markers and paper cuttings, so as to cultivate their DIY skills and reinforce what they have learnt through arts.

GreatBay China,Public Engagement, Special: Documentaries!,"  Our design and the whole story of our human practice is in fact, not merely confined in the 1,000 words we have written above. During the way to the proceeding of our lab project as well as our endeavor to let the world improve our project and meanwhile influencing the world, we have done a lot. We record and recall the entire story and make it into a documentary series. The documentary shows how we spared no efforts to conceive our human practice and communicate with the externality to contribute to solving the stray cat problem.

Download the documentary script here.
Episode 1: The stray cats roaming in the city is actually a very serious problem in many parts of the world because they can transmit diseases, annoy human by their calls for mate and disrupt the ecological stability. The current solutions to the stray cat problem are not very effective.
Episode 2: The idea of our human practice and hardware design—‘the kitty wonderland’ emerged when we heard that capturing stray cats is difficult and we found the potential of nepetalactone to attract cats. However, to make the ‘wonderland’ come true is hard. This episode starts with a stray cat seeing our hardware and sighs light-heartedly. 
Episode 3: We collaborated with professional designers in a maker space—X.factory to consolidate our design of the ‘kitty wonderland’. We have made several improvements.
Episode 4: In order to ensure our kitty wonderland’s safety and smooth implementation, we surveyed a lot of people including citizens, NGO administrators and government officials. We made several improvements after the survey. 
Episode 5: We draw out, model and demonstrate our final design.We uploaded the entire series onto a well-known Chinese video website, bilibili.com, under the ID 'CuL8er', to spread our idea. You can also visit this website and search the ID if you want to watch our videos in higher image quality.

From Jun/24 to Jun/26, we participated in the EurAsian Meetup organized by the teams TUDelft and BGI-College. We spared no efforts to present in an interesting and educating way and engage other teams. During the meetup, we received suggestions about the project (including how to convert nepetalactol to nepetalactone, what variables should be concerned in the co-culture system, etc.), presentation, poster and even mathematical modeling from various teams like TUDelft, EPFL, XJTLU China and SCUT China. 

Apart from obtaining suggestions, we also spread out idea effectively during the meetup by presenting as well as communicating with other teams. Our presentation in the meetup received the award as one of the two ‘Best Presentation’ teams among all. During the discussion, because of our teammate Rocky’s special talk on his understanding of biosafety, he was interviewed by TUDelft as a part of their human practice.


We also learned the essence of biosafety during the meetup, which helped us a lot when we were conducting our human practice after the event. We discovered that the key idea of ensuring biosafety in our project is through ‘Value Sensitive Design’, which is to contemplate whether our product will violate the rules in biosafety or challenge bioethics and use these concerns to improve our product to make it safer. We almost applied the strategy of ‘Value Sensitive Design’ extensively throughout our human practice.

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold),Introduction,"For the StyGreen project, Human Practices was not a box that needed to be ticked. On the contrary, it was a tool to integrate our project into the real world. As production of plastics can be a sensitive subject, Human Practices was important from the very start of our project. As Human Practices is not binary, but a continuous and constant process. Here provide a summary of the biggest influences on the design of our project. Additionally, many insights were gained by talking to our friends, family and complete strangers. One of the first questions was always: “why more plastics?”. We have discussed this with several experts and investigated the advantages and disadvantages of different plastics. We looked into both ‘biodegradable’ plastics, as well as non-biodegradable  plastics. The starting point of our project was a look at the world as it is. We have marvelous technologies which make our lives better, things that were problems 100 years ago are forgotten and information can be shared faster than ever. However, there is also something terribly wrong with this world. Temperature is rising, animals go extinct: our advancement is at the cost of the planet.We love all these advancements. We would lie if we say we did not, but we do want to solve the downside of our development. Therefore, we took a closer look at plastic. Plastic is a wonderful product and these days it is impossible to live without it. We looked into the production of plastic. Can we make clean plastic non-polluting plastic? And how do we use this plastic responsibly? On the Human Practices pages you'll found where our journey brought us; from schools to festivals; from start-ups to multinationals.

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold),The aim,"We are facing a huge increase in global population: from the current world population of 7.6 billion to an expected 9.8 billion people in 2050 [1]. This projected increase in global population leads to an increase in both food and energy consumption, which in turn in is associated with an increased emission of greenhouse gasses. Right now, we live in a plastic generation. The global production and consumption of plastics have been on the rise for over 50 years now, reaching a plastic consumption of 297.5 million tons by the end of 2015 [2]. Plastic products from the petrochemical industry have a high carbon footprint (Boonniteewanich, Pitivut, Tongjoy, & Lapnonkawow, 2014). The combination of global population increase and a mass consumed non-eco-friendly product, in the form of petroleum-based plastics, could be disastrous. This is one of the reasons that the Groningen iGEM team’s project attempts to produce (bio)styrene, a building block for many plastics, from cellulose as an alternative to petroleum-based styrene. In this section we have carried out a partial Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to identify the environmental impact of both petroleum-based styrene and bio-based styrene. The main purpose is to provide an insight in the environmental burden that is caused by the worldwide styrene industry in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2-eq) and to showcase our greener alternative.	For our LCA analysis we have used the Dutch Gross Energy Requirements values (GER) Values. These values are used for a ‘cradle to gate’ analysis and include all emissions that are needed to produce a certain product. These process emissions exclude any carbon flux from or to the atmosphere. In the case of a bio-based feedstock this is a complete analysis, because the carbon uptake is balanced with the emissions once the product is disposed of. For fossil fuel based styrene a value of 3,1 KG needs to be added to this  (Croezen & Lieshout, 2015) because these emission will lead to a net carbon emission. (see figure 1) (Croezen & Lieshout, 2015). A full LCA should also include other impact categories, however it is decided not to include these; we discovered the LCA analysis in a late phase of the project which forced us to simplify the analysis. "
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold),Analysis,"
					For our analysis, we compared the process of producing styrene from a bio-based feedstock to the process of producing styrene with petroleum as a feedstock. To define the cradle to gate emission of petroleum-based styrene we contacted two experts of the company CE Delft, the authors of a report stating the GER for industrial feedstock (Croezen & Lieshout, 2015). With their expert help, we were able to define the cradle to gate emission of petroleum-based styrene for our analysis, the value being: 7.8 CO2-eq per kilogram styrene.
				
					Now we need to compare the GER of petroleum-based styrene with the GER of our StyGreen. In order to do this we need to define the GER of StyGreen. The first step in defining the amount of CO2-eq per kilogram StyGreen is: defining the feedstock. We explored many different feedstock options. After comparing many possibilities, we decided to use recycled toilet paper. The main reason for this choice was the sustainability aspect. Recycled toilet paper is not used for anything at this moment. Therefore, it could be argued that it does not hold monetary value or even a negative monetary value. This means that we can add value to the life-cycle of toilet paper. Another reason for choosing toilet paper, is that we do not want to compete with the food industry. It might be feasible to use sugar, or first generation resources to produce styrene, but this does not fit into our view of a better world. 
				
					The second step was to calculate the carbon footprint of recycled toilet paper. The carbon footprint of a feedstock in a certain phase of the Life-Cycle analysis is proportional to the monetary value the feedstock holds in that particular phase. Since the recycled toilet paper is derived from paper, we looked into the monetary value of recycled toilet paper in combination to the resource, paper. After this we looked at the price of the toilet paper, and compared to the price of wood. This way, we could make a parallel to the toilet paper CO2-eq. The cradle to grave carbon emission of paper is 0.9 CO2-eq per kg paper (Croezen & Lieshout, 2015; figure 2 gives a visual representation of the factors determining the carbon emission of paper feedstock). 
				
					The cost of paper is €150 per ton. Due to the fact that toilet paper recycling is still in its infancy, it was hard to define the representative price for this resource. However, after talking to several experts(as you see here), we came to a price estimate of  €15 per ton. Since, toilet paper holds 10% of the monetary value of paper, we divided the CO2-eq by 10 as well, giving our recycled toilet paper feedstock a carbon footprint of 0.09 CO2-eq per kilogram. 
				Next we need to know how much energy (and therefore, how carbon emissions) is required to produce 1 kilogram of StyGreen. The energy requirement is based on the following formula (see table 2): From the energy requirements we can now derive the process emissions in CO2 per kg StyGreen by means of the following formula (see table 2):This brings us the a process emissions of 1.229 CO2 per kg produced StyGreen. If our genetically engineered yeast had a 100% conversion rate, we would need 10 kilograms of recycled toilet paper to produce 1 kg of StyGreen (based on the theoretical maximum yield). Which would mean that the carbon footprint of our StyGreen would be 2.129 CO2-eq per kg. This is a lot better than 7.8 CO2-eq per kg for petroleum-based styrene. However, at this point in time our conversion are not yet 100%. For each kilo of styrene we produce, we need 263 kilograms of cellulose (recycled toilet paper) right now. This would result in 24.89 CO2-eq per kg, which is way worse than regular (petroleum-based) styrene. This partly due to the assumptions made in the flux model, which assumes that yeast needs have a net biomass gain at all times. While, that is not necessary in our bioreactor. Moreover, the first version of our yeast is just a proof of concept. There are still a lot of parts that can be optimized. Both in the yeast strain itself, in the form of knock-outs, and in the bioreactor, by reducing the process emissions.  "
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Porter Analysis," 
					To investigate our position and opportunities on the market, we performed a Five Forces analysis. Here, we looked at the strengths of our buyers and suppliers, substitutes for our product, competition and new entrants. The results indicate that we have a beneficial position in relation to our suppliers as there are multiple sources of cellulose. However, the buyers have a high switching cost, which is a potential threat to our technology. For new entrants, a large amount of prior knowledge is needed to enter the market, which is one of our strengths. The substitutes of our product are different kinds of plastics, but as the plastic market is large and specific, this is not a great threat.

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Interviewing the Vice-President Materials of a Toy Multinational (16th October 2018),"Creating a bioplastic that is able to compete with conventional plastic means tapping into a market with unlimited potential. For example, 19 billion Lego elements are produced every year. This equals 2.16 million elements every hour, or 36.000 per minute. This premium toy-giant with an annual revenue of 4.8 billion USD (2017) is highly interested in swapping their current ABS feedstock to a more sustainable non-crude oil derived source. The Vice-President Materials of a Toy Multinational made time to sit down with us, despite a very full agenda. We discussed what drives companies when making transitioning decisions, what toy companies look for in materials and what to take into account throughout development. 
				While diving into the many applications of styrene, what most interested us was an application of styrene as raw material for a non-single use plastic. This was one of the drivers which pointed us towards Lego bricks: durable playing bricks for playful development. It turns out our visions align. During the course of our project, Lego has published various articles and press releases about their ambition to produce plant-based plastic playing bricks. The mentioned Vice-President Materials was happy to sit down with us to share views on the future of biobased plastics, as well as discussing some opportunities and limitations with regards to their production. Our discussion was highly insightful. Some highlights which will shape the future of our project:"

Ludos Imaginem is a new company which creates toys with which you are able to create something out of your own imagination. Because they recently started, they are really interested in making their product as sustainable as possible. Ludos is willing to invest in us when we have the first results, and has shared the data about the styrene they need for their product. This way, we can optimize our StyGreen to the demand of the customer. We keep in contact with Ludos to update them on the developments in our process. Ludos is very interested in a biobased way to create plastics. They do not want to compete with the food industry, and therefore encourage our way of working with sludge.

 NRK  is the Dutch Federation of plastic and rubber converters, with 20 different sub associations and 400 member companies. We talked to  Martin van Dord, innovation consultant at NRK and  Topsector Chemie. According to the NRK facts and figures (2017) circa 2000 kilotonnes of plastics were used in 2017, of which circa 20 kilotonnes (1%) were bioplastics. The main problem associated with the use of bioplastics is the price, which can be up to twice as high as that of virgin plastics. In order to contribute to the goals of the Paris Agreement, the objective is to lift the market share of bioplastics to 15% in 2030. Mr. van Dord thought our project was very interesting, since we came up with a new way to produce bioplastics. However, he was wondering why we would focus so much on styrene. Why not create a new bioplastic with even better qualities? He also stated that the business case should be a part in the project in order to get a better insight in the potential of genetically manufactured or engineered bioplastics and the scale of economic feasible production facilities. NRK also published an article about us on their website

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Bioclear Earth: Jeroen Tideman (27th July 2018) ,"
					We have been in touch with employees of Bioclear Earth, who gave us great suggestions on the financial aspects of our project. Because pure cellulose is more expensive than glucose, we needed to find a cellulose-rich waste stream which we could use in our process. They came up with the idea to use recycled toilet paper, which can not be used for other purposes due to its public perception. Subsequently, they explained to us how the market for enzymes works and also connected us with various people in the market. Additionally, they told us about various parties that are working on the conversion of cellulose into glucose. Lastly they gave us the suggestion to use glucose instead of cellulose for our project. However, we decided this was not feasible as we do not want to be competing with the the food industry.

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Avantium: Ronny Pals (31st August 2018) ,"
					Rianne, Jens, Benno, Bram and team associate Tjerk Douma visited Chemical Park Delfzijl where we had a meeting with Avantium. Avantium is chemically breaking down wood chips to hemicellulose, glucose and lignin. Their technology allows them to break down cellulose with acid to glucose monomers in one reactor with high yields while recovering the acid. We are trying to do exactly the same, but enzymatically by employing our cellulosome. We agreed to test the suitability of Avantiums glucose for growth medium for our cells. Beyond that we learned a lot about the process of valorizing innovations in general. They gave us many insights regarding the financial and technical bottlenecks that stand between a promising idea and a large scale profitable industrial process. We were impressed by Avantiums technology as it is robust, works with almost any type of wood and requires only very little material preparation, especially in comparison to our enzymatic approach. An important take-away for us was that we have to consider the expenses and environmental implications of our cellulose pretreatment (grinding, autoclaving, phosphorylating) as well.
				"
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), BioBTX: Pieter Imhof (25th July 2018) ,"
					As suggested by the Science Shop, we got into contact with Pieter Imhof of BioBTX. This company produces chemical intermediates out of biomass, however they use a chemical process. They explained to us how they use pyrolysis and combine this with a catalytic conversion step. In this way they are able to reach aromatics yields of approximately 30-70%, with BTX (Benzene, Toluene, Xylene) yields ranging from 5-40%, with yields dependent on the feedstock and used process conditions. 
					Regarding our project, Mr. Imhof thought that the process of turning glucose into styrene does not have high enough yields to be economically feasible. However, he thought that the conversion of cellulose to glucose in one reactor, combined with glucose to styrene conversion could be an interesting improvement. Additionally, he explained that CO2 is released at every chemical reaction step, the magnitude depending on reaction conditions. So, whereas our method would not be able to meet industrial needs, it would likely be greener than the chemical process of refining biomass, and significantly better than a fossil based process. These steps come together in the Life Cycle Analysis, which can be found on the wiki and in given references. Mr. Imhof explained to us that we should not go too deep into this and provided us with helpful references about their own research.

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Photanol: Wilmar van Grondelle (12th September 2018) ,"
Photanol is a platform renewable chemicals company that utilises proprietary engineered cyanobacteria to process carbon dioxide (CO2) and sunlight into valuable chemical products. They have performed a lot of research in the laboratory, and are scaling up now. They aim to demonstrate that their product works on an industrial scale, and Wilmar elaborated on the process from their concept to where they are now. The concept of Photanol started at university. Together with the university, they went to the University Holding, to get an initial investment. From this point on a biorefinery plan, business plan and LCA were made to attract more investors. He told us that it is important to have a good business plan and LCA when you look for investors, because these are the things that people will look at. Another good way to get income is using different subsidies. Photanol now has an industrial partner with whom they work together to scale their project up further. Wilmar adviced us to contact the GGO bureau and to keep close contact with them, as they know everything about safety and regulations. Especially in the phase where we are in now, it is good to contact them so we can put the safety into the design of our project. One example is that a GMO can never outcompete its wild-type. Besides that, there are two important permits you have to keep in mind; the GMO permit and the environment permit. These take in total about 6 months to get!

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Unipol ,"
					Unipol is an European producer of EPS (expanded polystyrene, also known as styrofoam). They produce 90.000 tonnes of high quality EPS annually. Styrene is their main raw material. They are a member of EUMEPS, PlasticsEurope and OIK and are ISO 14001 certified. Unipol is interested in StyGreen, as styrene is their main raw material. Therefore, StyGreen would allow them to significantly increase the sustainability of their EPS production. We have presented our research to Unipol and they are highly interested and enthusiastic about our project. Hence we have acquired a substantial investment from them. Their financial investment as well as interest in our technology as a large industrial player is highly valuable to the entrepreneurial success of our project. We plan to continue our quest to produce biobased styrene in a scaled-up industrial setting. 
				"
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Fablab: Winand Slingenbergh ,"
					As we aim to produce the plastic monomer styrene, making actual plastic products was an exciting idea. As the quantities of styrene we managed to produce are not large enough for industrial applications yet, we found an interesting partner in Fablab, a 3D printing venture. Fablab is an open-source, global network that originated from an MIT course titled ‘How to make almost anything'. They have stayed true to this ideal and offer a wide variety of plastic and wood working techniques in their laboratories. 
					3D printing with ABS plastic is possible, but it has some drawbacks, hence we decided to collaborate with Fablab Groningen without actually using StyGreen for 3D printing. We quickly realized that 3D printed biological structures can be of great educational value. Therefore, we made prints of the most important enzymes in our project: the cellulose binding domain, the endogluconase, the beta-glucosidase and the Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase. We also printed some of their ligands and matched them size wise to showcase where the pocket with the active site in the enzyme is and which chemical alteration is happening.
					We also developed a kit of building blocks for styrene, butadiene, acrylnitril and divinylbenzene that can showcase the process of copolymerization through magnets. On top of that our mascot Styrene Steve was 3D printed multiple times and given as present to some of our sponsors as a nice gesture and to keep iGEM in people’s minds. All structures we designed with FabLab are open source and can be found on their website https://www.thingiverse.com/.
				"
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), ZAP: Drs. R.J. van Linschoten (4th September 2018),"
					One of the first steps when considering upscaling of a process is finding a suitable location for a pilot plant. The province of Groningen is a strong agricultural and industrial area. Therefore, the province can support the conversion of waste streams from biomass into high-end products. ZAP, the Zernike Advanced Processing innovation cluster, is located on the Zernike campus, along with the University of Groningen, the Hanze University of Applied Sciences and a number of companies. This unique location offers a great opportunity to share and increase knowledge. ZAP offers a test environment for bio-based experiments in the northern region of the Netherlands, where they provide the facilities to set up a pilot plant. ZAP is interested in acting upon the need to lessen our reliance on fossil fuels. We met with drs. R.J. van Linschoten, director of the Zernike Advanced Processing and discussed the prerequisites for setting up a pilot plant.

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), NIOZ: Prof. Dr. Klaas Timmermans (27th August 2018),"
					At present, extensive research is carried out on the culturing of green algae. If green algae can be successfully cultured on the open sea, this provides a virtually unlimited source of cellulose. We arranged a skype meeting with Prof. dr. Klaas Timmermans, Senior scientist ecophysiology of seaweeds, head of Department Estuarine and Delta Systems (EDS) at  NIOZ and Honorary Professor at the University of Groningen. NIOZ is the Royal Dutch Institute for Sea Research, and is involved in research in the Netherlands as well as far beyond the Dutch border on topics such as biology, physics, chemistry and geography. We spoke with Prof. dr. Timmermans about our design and the potential usage of cellulose from green algae for our iGEM project. Currently, green algae are mainly cultured for their proteins and partly for their carbohydrate content. However, cellulose is a residual product at the moment, for which no suitable purpose has been found at NIOZ. In case we can show a proof-of-concept in our iGEM project, we could close the loop in green algae culturing, so all fractions are used. Prof. dr. Timmermans informed us  that there is still a long way to go before culturing green algae on the open sea is reality. On top of that, the separation of the different fractions (proteins, carbohydrates, etc.) proves to be difficult. All in all, the potential upside is enormous, once the research on culturing green algae has developed further. We are then able to tap into an infinite source of cellulose and use all fractions of the cultured green algae. A win-win situation.

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), RIVM ,"
					The Dutch Governmental Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) wants to stimulate Dutch iGEM teams to consider the broader effects of their project on the world surrounding us. This includes investigating ethical, societal, and technical aspects concerning the project. They asked us to adhere to the Safe-by-Design concept, which states that safety should be an integral part of each project, to be considered during every phase and aspect from the early beginnings all the way to the end.
				"
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Tjerk Douma (28th June 2018) ,"
					We sat down with Tjerk Douma, a Master student in Energy and Environmental Sciences. Tjerk explained the importance of a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and what factors are taken into account. We concluded that it may be interesting to look at the difference in the LCA of StyGreen and oil based Styrene. We agreed that Tjerk would help us with the LCA, and had regular meetings afterwards. This resulted in our Carbon Footprint Analysis

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Drs. Karin Ree (11th July 2018) ,"
					Drs. Karin Ree is a member of the Science Shop in Groningen. The Science Shop connects ambitious students to companies or academic research outside their field. As we were looking for connections to the bioplastic industry, Karin was able to give us great advice on who we should contact. She helped us to find contacts inside and outside of the university. Furthermore, she has sent us a various useful papers on the sustainability of bioplastics.

					Gert Jan Euverink is the University of Groningen representative in the CaDOS project. Toilet paper in sewage material contains roughly 80% cellulose. In the CaDOS project, this cellulose material is used to drain water from the sludge, which improves the purification process. Furthermore, Euverink advises companies on the implementation of their technical ideas. His expertise has been helpful to previous iGEM teams, since he was a supervisor of the winning team of Groningen in 2012!

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Prof. Dr. Katja Loos (5th July 2018) ,"
					Biodegradable plastics, like PLA, are technically biodegradable but only under controlled
					conditions. In nature they still take a long time to degrade on their own, only a bit faster than
					for example polystyrene. However, PLA being “biodegradable” sends a message that it is
					okay to throw it away anywhere because if its “biodegradability”, only adding to the problem.
					Just recently, the EU has moved to ban single use plastics. Therefore, what we should do is

Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Prof. Dr. Francesco Picchioni (3rd Oktober 2018) ,"
					We went to Francesco Picchioni, an expert in the field of polymers, to ask his view on styrene and our project design. Did he see the benefits, or would he think it was an unrealistic design? He explained to us that styrene is a very good material for various reasons. The first is its transparency, which is why it is easily colored with other chemicals. Styrene furthermore contains an aromatic ring and pi-pi stackings of these rings. This leads to the fact that styrene-based plastics have a high TG (Glass Transition Temperature). These connections are way stronger compared to the ester bonds in PET and PLA. No other plastics have these special characteristics, and therefore styrene is irreplaceable. Right now, styrene is not recycled to a high extent, as the price of newly produced styrene is lower. However, because styrene is a thermoplastic, it is easily recycled in case of a stronger market pull. Picchioni was suprised that biological styrene production was feasible. If a high yield can be engineered, this would be a major discovery and he would be very interested. 
				"
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Prof. Dr. A. J. M. Driessen ,"
				In order to gain more insight into strain optimization, we met with professor Driessen, head of the molecular microbiology department at the University of Groningen. We discussed the best ways to implement and optimize our design. Driessen provided us with many helpful suggestions. For example, we went from the concept of two separate coexisting yeast strains (one cellulolytic, one producing styrene), to one yeast strain doing both processes simultaneously. Furthermore, we discussed metabolic engineering to gain higher yields, for example multiple knock-outs which we could implement. Finally, Driessen proposed to use the CRISPR-Cas9 technique to genomically integrate our genes of interest, instead of using several plasmids. Moreover, Driessen connected us to important contacts as well as providing us with additional laboratory space. "
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Prof. Dr. B. Poolman (1st June 2018),"
					One of our team members visited professor Poolman of the Enzymology research group to discuss the possible effects of styrene toxicity in our design. During literature study we discovered the existence of styrene exporters and we wanted to discuss whether expression of such an exporter in S. cerevisiae would be beneficial for our design and styrene yield. Poolman pointed out that expressing prokaryotic proteins in eukaryotes is extremely difficult, but pointed towards the Pdr5 export protein and ABC transporters. Furthermore he suggested performing an evolution experiment in S. cerevisiae to decrease the sensitivity of our yeast towards styrene. "
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Shreyans Chordia (27th September 2018),"
						Shreyans Chordia, a PhD student at the Biomolecular Chemistry & Catalysis group, works on styrene production in E. coli and provided us with an E. coli codon optimized version of the PAL2 gene. Shreyans has been able to produce styrene in E. coli at quite significant levels. He suggested the possibility of coculturing our cellulose degrading yeast strain with his styrene producing E. coli to convert cellulose to styrene in one bioreactor. He offered to help with the experimental setup and conducting the experiments. Furthermore, he got us in contact with Balin Fridrich, who works on the degradation of lignocellulose. "
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Prof. Dr. Marco Fraaije (20th July 2018),"
						Professor Marco Fraaije is an expert in the fields of biology, biochemistry, biotechnology and in particular enzyme engineering. His group published an extremely useful article for our project describing a fast and sensitive method for the detection of cellulase activity. We had a fruitful discussion about the assay described in the paper. One of the subjects that we discussed was the feasibility to detect cellulase activity with the assay while using our intact yeast cells instead of purified proteins. Finally, professor Fraaije provided us with the possibility for assistance, usage of the lab and supplied the materials required for the experiments."
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Dr. W.C. Szymanski (27th September 2018),"
						Szymanski is an assistant professor, at the department of radiology and imaging, at the UMCG (University Medical Center Groningen). His fields of interests are molecular medical imaging and photopharmacology. Wiktor Szymanski was willing to help us optimize the protocol for the phosphorylation of cellulose at the 6th position. Furthermore, he was of great help performing the experiment and provided us with a lab and equipment for the experiment. The phosphorylation of cellulose was performed to increase the solubility of the polymer. The improved solubility resulted in an improved accessibility of the cellulosome complex towards the cellulose polymer. The cellulosome complex chops the cellulose polymer into glucose molecules. These glucose molecules are obtained by the yeast cells, as carbon source, and converted into styrene molecules."
Groningen,Integrated Human Practices (Gold), Intellectual Property Office RUG (8th October 2018),"
						To see if we could patent parts of our project, we contacted the IP center of the University of Groningen. We discussed three important subjects: inventorship, novelty and inventivity. The first subject we had to discuss was inventorship. Who contributed substantially to our project? Besides our team members, to what extent were the supervisors part of our idea? After consulting other iGEM teams, we decided that the patent should be shared with the supervisors. For the novelty of our project, it was important that the to be patented subject was not published already. We encountered problems with our own disclosure here due to our outreach and education activities. The most difficult part of a patent is the inventivity. Since we combine several methods of degrading cellulose together, this was an important option for patenting. Subsequently, we also had to think about the financial aspects of the patent. Would companies pay to use our technology? We discussed this factor with several investors and several companies that are highly interested in our product. "

Groningen,Integrated   models,Introduction,"The team decided to use a scaffold to bind together the cellulases that will allow the yeast to degrade cellulose. Experimental data suggests that cellulose gets degraded more effectively this way. Intuitively the scaffold  allows the yeast to more efficiently absorb the products of the degradation due to to proximity, but does scaffolding come at a cost? This model aims to simulate a scaffold similar to the one used in the lab mathematically, to see whether it suffers from any disadvantage and  whether the choice of cellulases make a difference. For comparison, a system of free enzymes was also modelled in a similar way."
Groningen,Integrated   models,Method,"It is assumed that any advantage of scaffolding will also occur for a system of three cellulases. The model follows the degradation of cellulose chains by two enzymes, an exoglucanase and endoglucanase. To simplify the problem further, it is assumed that the cellulase chains are maximally 100 units long and are all completely soluble. This shouldn’t stop the model from working because cellulose is commercially available in soluble form and at short chain length distributions."
Groningen,Integrated   models,Free Enzymes,"Figure 1. Table Of Variables For Mechanistic ModelThe breakdown of cellulose by two free cellulases is described by balances in figure 2.As described by Levine et al., the complexation step of the cellulase enzyme to the cellulose is so fast compared to the catalysis, that the complex concentration is considered to be in equilibrium. 
		This allows the for expression of the complexes in terms of the concentrations of the chains, enzymes and equilibrium constants (also called dissociation constants), figure 3. It must be kept in mind that the enzymes are complexing with available sites. An endoglucanase binds to the 1-4 glucose bonds, so the concentration available is the concentration of chain i, times the amount of binding sites on chain i. The exoglucanase can only attach to chain ends.
		The equilibrium constants are assumed to be the same regardless of the length of the chain. The values for the equilibrium constants were retrieved from the Levine et al. simulation.
	Next the concentration balances for each cellulose were derived, to create a system of differential equations. An example of such a derivation (for 2<i<99) is given in figure 4. The other rate equations, not shown, are derived in exactly the same way. The kcat values for the catalytic steps were also retrieved from Levine’s paper. A summary of all the constants used can be seen in figure 5.Figure 5. Table Of Constants used for free enzyme model.The concentrations of free enzymes (not in complex)  is also a  dependent variable, and therefore must be described by an equation for the system to be solvable. This can be done with the general Derivation in figure 6. Since the complexation is considered instantaneous, initial conditions for the free enzyme are calculated by subtracting the  enzymes complexed with the cellulose feed from the enzyme feed."
Groningen,Integrated   models,Scaffolded Enzymes,"To model the effect of a scaffold, several additional assumptions are made: The cellulose differentials for the scaffold are derived in the same way as the free enzymes. This time, only one enzyme acts on the cellulose, and every reaction leads to the production of cellobiose.It can be seen the affinity of the Endoglucanase for a particular chain goes up with its length, as evident from the factor (J-1). At times, the affinity of the Endoglucanase is higher than that of the Exoglucanase. According to the assumptions, the scaffold should benefit from the highest affinity ( lowest dissociation constant). To do this, the dissociation constant is allowed vary with the length of the corresponding chain by the equation in figure 8. This equation is a smooth approximation of the maximum of the affinities of both enzymes as a function of chain length. It had to be used because the mathematica solver cannot work with discontinuities.Figure 9 shows how the dissociation constants of exoglucanase and endoglucanases vary with chain length along with function this model uses to approximate that of the scaffold’s."
Groningen,Integrated   models,Results,"The results show a sigmoidal production of short-length sugars with time. It can be seen that the scaffold is slightly slower than the system of free enzymes. The degradation of the C100 chains show an exponential decreasing relationship with time. Here, also it can be seen that the free enzymes of are slightly faster than the scaffold. The effect of the difference in kCats of the constituent enzymes was also plotted (fig 12).  Decreasing the difference in kCats causes the production of absorbable products to increase in rate, a rightward shift in the function. On figure 12 the effect of varying the difference between the constituent enzyme’s kcats can be seen. As the kCats get closer together, the efficiency goes up. Although for cellulases this effect isn’t very strong,  this would be something important to keep in mind in future scaffolding experiments.	"
Groningen,Integrated   models,Conclusions,"
In this model a scaffold was modelled using a system of differential equations. The performance of the scaffold on degrading cellulose chains was compared with that of free enzymes. The effect of varying the kCats between the constituent enzymes was also investigated. The results show that the scaffold performs overall a bit slower than the free enzymes. However, the difference isn't big enough to say that using a scaffold would cause a significant disadvantage in terms of reaction rate. The team could therefore use it and make use of the other advantages it offers, such as giving the yeast cell higher proximity to the products. Also, the scaffold will strongly benefit from the cellulose binding domain that MD simulations have found to give it a very large adsoprtion-affinity. Although beyond the scope of this project, this strong affinity of the binding domain could be assumed to increase the local concentration of cellulose, explaining the scaffold's high experimental speeds.

Groningen,Education & Public Engagement, The Dutch Biotechnology Conference (22nd May 2018),"
        This year our iGEM team was fortunate enough to be invited to the Dutch biotechnology conference. On the 22nd of May two members of our iGEM team woke up at the crack of dawn to travel to Ede and attend the conference. The conference opened with a welcome speech, poster presenters could pitch their idea. Most of the pitches were from PhD students, but the Dutch iGEM teams also pitched their idea. Here we also gave a short pitch of our idea. After the introduction we got the opportunity to walk around the congress. We walked by the many company stands and posters, looking for inspiration and collaboration opportunities.This was also a nice moment to talk to the other iGEM teams about how their iGEM was going. The projects were explained and helpful feedback was exchanged. During the day many interesting topics were presented by Phds but also by biotech professionals. In between the talks we presented our poster to people and answered questions. Here we also received lots of useful feedback and pointers from various people who had worked on similar projects. After a long, but fruitful day we returned home with a notebook full of new ideas and many new contacts who were happy to help us with any future problems.

On the 28th of July we went to mall Paddepoel. Here we showed the bacteria on the hands of children after they washed them, and explained what bacteria are. To older people, we explained the possibilities of genetic modification and asked them what they thought of it. A lot of people were very eager to talk to us about it, and we had a lot of insights about how non-academia think about GMOs. We’ve added a few quotes by people who would rather be anonymous. "
Groningen,Education & Public Engagement, Noorderzon Performing Arts Festival Groningen (25th and 26th August 2018),"
Every year this festival is organized in one of the parks in Groningen. Over 100.000 people visit this mostly free festival. While this festival focuses mainly on arts there are also initiatives to bring science closer to the people. Our own university has a special department specifically for this goal. In collaboration with them we also brought our idea to the people. Sciencelinx has created their own building blocks from bioplastic to make the idea of DNA more accessible. These building blocks were used by children to make various structures. At the festival we spent two days talking to people about bioplastic and explaining how we would make our own plastic. "
Groningen,Education & Public Engagement,"Ted talk on “The Cause, Size and Solution to our Plastic Problem","On the 26th of september Bram and Owen gave a lecture the problems with plastic and how we try to tackle this problem. People were very enthusiastic about our lecture and stayed after the lecture to talk more about the problems with plastic. A lot of interest was also expressed into the specific workings of synthetic biology. The Noorderzon Festival was a nice opportunity to hear how people think about our project. Furthermore, we made people aware of the plastic problems in the world and our idea to combat these problems.

Groningen,Education & Public Engagement, iGEM BBQ (5th September 2018),"
To raise awareness for our project’s cause and to gain additional funds, we organized a BBQ. A few
weeks before the planned date, the 5th of September, invitations were sent out to friends and
colleagues. Posters and flyers were also put up around campus. On the morning of the day, team
members not busy in the lab started setting up the pavilions and running other chores. Meat was
picked up from butcher “de Groene Weg” who offered 4 kilos of sustainably produced meat for
free. Beer was fetched from the “Baxbier” brewery, who also gave us their beer free of charge as
part of their support for the iGEM team. True to their environmentally friendly theme, the iGEM
team bought biodegradable cutlery. After a tiresome afternoon setting up tents and gathering all the
necessary equipment and food on the lawn between the Bernoullibourg and Linnaeussborg
buildings, the team was ready to accommodate their guests.
There was a turn-out of about 100 people who stayed from 3 in the afternoon until almost 11 at
night. During the BBQ, the members mingled with their guests to talk about their project and its
implications. To help with this, the project poster was displayed. It was also a chance for the
members’ families and friends to find out exactly what they had been up to during the summer.
In addition to payment for entry, the iGEM team also organized an auction with items kindly
donated by their sponsors. These included: A visit to the Strip Museum, the Groningen Museum,
the Northern Ship museum, tickets a concert by the Cool Quest at the Simplon, a painting by one
of the iGEMers, a workshop on public speaking by the USVA, a Beer tasting and guided tour of the
Baxbier Brewery and finally a private Kite Surfing lesson with one of the team’s associates from
EV Biotech.
The BBQ proved a great success as 1200 euros were raised for the project and as the good
reputation of the iGEM competition at the University of Groningen was perpetuated.

Groningen,Education & Public Engagement, Education day,"
The University of Groningen organizes the annual Education Day. The aim of the Education Day is promoting interaction among lecturers and stimulating a dialogue about what good education actually is. Visitors attended parallel sessions, dynamic workshops, poster presentations and demonstrations. Lecturers and students exchanged best practices, learned from each other and generated new ideas. Over fifty lecturers and students talked about the newest developments. We, the iGEM team of Groningen 2018, have been invited by dr. Van der Graaf of the University of Groningen to attend this years’ education day to give an workshop about what we think of the iGEM project and how it is integrated in the colloquium of the University of Groningen."
Groningen,Education & Public Engagement, Maker Faire (29th and 30th September 2018),"
The Maker Faire is a festival for everything related to new technology where young children, students and grown-ups can come together to make, discover and learn. You are able to build a glider, print whatever you can imagine using a 3D-printer or design your own game. This years’ festival was organized in Eindhoven on the 29th and 30th of September. In collaboration with Science Linx, our iGEM team had its own stand on this years’ festival. On this stand we presented the GEN.ERATE, this are red Lego-like building blocks made from bioplastic. GEN.ERATE can be used to educate children on the basics of DNA, but moreover they can be used to create enormous structures. During the event we engaged with parents in conversation about the importance of bioplastics and we taught children on the basics of DNA using the GEN.ERATE as an tool. We also found out that working on a structure like GEN.ERATE can give children an insight in spatial orientation, which is not only useful for explaining the structure of DNA but also for their general development.

Groningen,Education & Public Engagement, Scholieren Academie ,"
        The Scholierenacademie is an organization that organizes activities for mainly elementary school students. The iGEM team of Groningen and Scholierenacademie have collaborated over the last few years to engage with the children from the elementary schools in East-Groningen, tangentially less fortunate socioeconomic background, to interest those children in biological sciences and the university in general. The Scholierenacademie initiated this project since research has shown that kids from the eastern part of the province Groningen tend to choose higher education less frequently. By starting really early with informing these kids about the potential of an academic career, the Scholierenacademie hopes to attract more interest and offer these kids a more informed decision. Together with Douwe van der Tuin, coordinator of the children university, we went to six primary schools to provide a guest lecture on: what is the university? What do students do? And how the children themselves can contribute to a more sustainable future. The six schools will also come over to the iGEM laboratory and do a little experiment on bioplastics themselves. We designed to separate experiment of one hour each and a tour through the university building.  In total, we engaged with over 100 primary school children between 9 October and 19 October.

They organize and support various activities with the aim to excite kids in the sciences. The iGEM team of Groningen and Science Linx have had fruitful collaboration for many years now. One of the projects we organized in collaboration with Science Linx this year is a guest lecture for a 6VWO class (the final year before of high school before university). The focus of this lecture was placing this years’ iGEM project, producing bio-styrene in yeast from cellulose, in an ecological perspective and highlight what kind of metabolic pathways we used to achieve our styrene producing yeast. Moreover, we have setup an experiment in the lab of prof. dr. Jan Kok for this 6VWO class. On the 6th of November (after we are back from Boston) this class will work on a small scale evolution experiment.

Hamburg,Human Practices,Human Practices,"Our project deals with the issue of fighting malaria-transmitting vectors, for example Anopheles gambiae. With the S.H.I.E.L.D. we have developed a novel malaria prevention method which contains engineered bacteria to lure and kill mosquitoes. We are aware that working with GMOs and keeping them in a device in the field implies a lot of different aspects to think about. Therefore, we talked to both national and international experts working in malaria research and biosafety. With the help of their expertise we were able to further improve design and safety of our project enabling it to fulfil its purpose of safely and sustainably combating malaria."
Hamburg,Human Practices,Integrated Human Practices,"Before starting with the practical implementation in the lab we met biosafety expert Dr. Mirko Himmel. A biochemist by training, he currently works at the Carl Friedrich von Weizäcker-Centre for Science and Peace Research, where he specializes in biological arms control and biosecurity matters. He introduced us to the problem of Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC). After his presentation we discussed safety- and security-relevant aspects of our project. One major topic was the insect toxin we had originally chosen as kill mechanisms of the S.H.I.E.L.D. When asked by Dr. Himmel about its properties, it became obvious that the data available was not sufficient to ensure the safe usage in our trap. Published data indicated a low toxicity to mammals, which outside the field of bioinsecticide research can be interpreted as very toxic in realistic doses.Since the toxin might prove to be harmful to humans and other mammals we decided to use an alternative insecticide which was known to be exclusively toxic to insects, BjaIT, which we submitted as BBa_K2588019. BjaIT inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels of insects exclusively while not being able to bind to mammalian sodium channels.We are fully aware of the dual use potential sustained production of a toxin raises. We discussed how to deal with information on toxin-producing and -secreting bacteria with both Dr. Mirko Himmel and Piers Millett, iGEM Director of Safety and Security. Together, we decided to publish all results in wiki and registry, but not to release details on the different toxins, production methods, and experimental and design workflows, increasing the effort people with possible harmful intent would have to take to recreate our experiments with possibly more harmful agents.With Dr. Mirko Himmel, we discussed the danger of unintentionally releasing the GMOs used in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Two different aspects must be considered:We had to make sure that the trap is robust in order to prevent breakage or leaks under intended use stresses as well as stronger environmental influences and forces. Therefore, we decided to use a very hard, durable, UV resistant, autoclavable plastic employing strong sealing rings to ensure the S.H.I.E.L.D. is not easily damaged, releasing GMOs in the process.On the other hand, in the unlikely case that GMOs are released into the environment, they must not be able to spread uncontrollably. While the implemented growth inhibition module BBa_K2588021 ensures that the modified bacteria would not be able to proliferate even under ideal circumstances, we would suggest to introduce a kill switch, such as the Amber substitution kill switch introduced by iGEM Darmstadt 2016 into the organism before using the S.H.I.E.L.D. in the field. A stop codon (Amber codon) is introduced at the beginning of a gene coding for a transcription factor, which under desired conditions inhibits the expression of a lethal gene. A special amino acid that do not naturally occur in E. coli corresponds to the amber codon for the gene to be elongated past the stop signal. In the S.H.I.E.L.D. this amino acid would be provided by the cyanobacteria. In the environment, E. coli would no longer be provided with it, causing the production of the transcription factor to cease. Therefore, the activation of the lethal gene would ensure the death of E. coli cells outside of the trap. Since genetically altered E. coli are only able to survive in the environment as a symbiosis with cyanobacteria and the survival of those in African climatic conditions is highly unlikely, Dr. Himmel agreed this would be a feasible approach to ensure our traps biosafety.We strongly suggest to implement this feature to anyone deciding to further develop our project before applying it for registration. However, the limited time available in an iGEM period did not allow us to implement the complete iGEM Darmstadt 2016 project.With Dr. Mirko Himmel, we raised two additional questions we could not find sufficient answers to: Could diseases be spread between mosquitoes landing on the S.H.I.E.L.D., and could mosquitoes develop resistances against the toxin we employ?To gain more knowledge about malaria-transmitting vectors like Anopheles gambiae, and to answer some of our questions regarding new and existing mosquito traps, we interviewed Dr. Thomas Jacobs from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, who currently works on the topic “Protective and pathogenetic role of T-cells in murine malaria.”From the mosquito expert we learned that female mosquitoes are fed with blood in the lab using a bowl with pre-warmed blood which is covered with parafilm for mosquitoes to land on and sting through. During this process, the parafilm gets destroyed irreversibly. With our focus on sustainability, this approach would not be feasible for use in the S.H.I.E.L.D. To accomodate mosquitoes landing and taking up the insecticide, we implemented a self-healing hydrogel. However, we worried bacteria could grow on the hydrogel surface, possibly infecting the landing mosquitoes or being distributed by them. When told about the S.H.I.E.L.D.’s approach, Dr. Jacobs assessed transfer of pathogens between landing mosquitoes to be very unlikely because even under laboratory circumstances the infection of mosquitoes is quite hard to achieve, and pathogens would not be able to survive for on the hydrogel for longer times. Since we are aware of insecticide resistances being an abundant problem in fighting malaria, we discussed how likely a novel resistance to our toxin could occur. In his opinion, this should not be a major problem as long as the dose of our toxin is high enough to kill the mosquitoes swiftly enough to prevent them from developing a resistance. Even if a resistance to the toxin should occur, the modular BioBrick system would allow a relatively easy substitution with another insecticide.We also met with the Deutsche Malaria GmbH and most importantly their managing director Dr. David Hutchinson, who started working as a clinician on tropical medicine in 1971. He suggested to use the S.H.I.E.L.D. to fight mosquitoes transmitting dengue virus as well as malaria. This led to further consideration to use the S.H.I.E.L.D. to fight other threats caused by insects. Apart from mosquitoes we could target different vermins through modulation of the S.H.I.E.L.D.We sought to gain insights from malaria and mosquito experts from malaria risk regions in which the S.H.I.E.L.D. would be used. Working in Hamburg, Germany, we could not guarantee to not miss details and technical requirements that apply in malaria risk regions in warmer climates, and environments we are not used to.We interviewed multiple experts from Uganda and Tanzania, countries in which malaria still threatens many people despite significant efforts towards malaria elimination. With the help of iGEM Makerere, we reached out to local experts with different professional backgrounds to get an assessment of the feasibility of our project in Africa. We designed an open questionnaire for them, answering both specific questions and leaving room for advice they would like to give us moving forward with our project. From their answers we gained valuable insights on characteristics important for both the technological feasibility, and the social acceptance for people working and living with the S.H.I.E.L.D.First and most importantly, it is beneficial to use long-maintenance devices for malaria prevention. Many preventive measures against malaria are not maintained properly due to the financial strain this puts on the population. Once placed, our self-sustaining trap would minimize this problem as well as problems caused by lacking infrastructure in rural areas. Beyond that, the main problem for people living in affected areas is that using repellents, insecticides or other precautionary methods like bed nets has an great impact of their daily life. Since people are inconvenienced by some of the necessary precautions compliance with them is oftentimes problematic. While we strongly encourage the continued use of bed nets and other available safety measures, with the S.H.I.E.L.D. we aim to provide an additional appliance that will place no further strain on the people’s comfort.Another strong advocate of a multi-pronged approach to combating malaria we had the pleasure to talk to is Dr. Andrew Hammond, one of the leading researchers in the field of malaria control through genetic based technologies. He is postdoctoral researcher at the Imperial College in London. Dr. Andrew Hammond helped pushing our project further by sharing his expertise on project development and legislature with us. He especially gave us a lot of suggestions regarding the experimental design, for example in conducting mosquito experiments and testing odour baits. We got an overview of possible locations for the S.H.I.E.L.D. to be placed for maximal impact. Specifically close to possible breeding sites, such as stagnant freshwater, close to bushes and on the outside of houses by eaves are optimal locations to ensure mosquitoes are eliminated before they get in contact with residents. The latter would allow us to use the natural odours that emanate from households through  the eaves  to lure in the mosquitoes in addition to our bait system, and eliminating them with our trap before they actually enter the houses.We would like to thank everyone who gave us their priceless input in order to help us improve our project and its implementation even further."
Hamburg,Human Practices,Student Research Center Hamburg,"Since we know how important it is to spark interests at an early age, we wanted to promote knowledge about life sciences and synthetic biology, as well as share our passion for science in general. What better place to do so than Hamburg’s Student Research Center (Schülerforschungszentrum, SFZ)?Founded in 2017, the Student Research Center is a relatively young institution that gives students of all ages from different schools the chance to work on their individual research projects in their free time. Since the biology and biochemistry lab is not ready yet, we had the opportunity to advise how to equip the lab. We have also planned project days for students once the lab is fully equipped.We were delighted to give a presentation on synthetic biology, iGEM and our project on the first ever Pizza Friday, an event where all students and advisors working at the SFZ come together to exchange information about their projects. Afterwards, we had a lively discussion with the students. In the long-term, we are available as mentors to students doing research at the SFZ and to help with questions they might have about their projects.Who knows, with our help there might even be an iGEM Hamburg high school team in a couple of years."
Hamburg,Human Practices,Discussion with Deutsche Malaria Gesellschaft,"To introduce ourselves, get expertise on the S.H.I.E.L.D. and discuss further cooperation with the Deutsche Malaria GmbH we met with Dr. David Hutchinson, Erik Lindemann and Frank Oertel. Dr. David Hutchinson is an expert with more than 50 years of experience in the field of tropical medicine mainly working on malaria treatments as a clinical research clinician. Erik Lindemann and Frank Oertel offered us their expertise in funding and development to build a commercial product.After explaining our idea, we discussed the practical application of the S.H.I.E.L.D and the future challenges for a broad implementation. When explaining their vision in joint fight against malaria, Mr. Oertel mentioned the frightening numbers and put our focus on the high child mortality rate.Mr. Oertel: “We think the need to fight malaria is getting more relevant. There are about 500.000 deaths and 200 million infections due to malaria and 80 percent of these deaths are children below an age of five.”At the end of our discussion Dr. David Hutchinson drew our attention to another important topic, we had not investigated at that time.Dr. Hutchinson: “But out there is a huge disease, causing immense morbidity, insect vector borne disease, which is dengue. That is a crippling disease. […] Very seriously, you should bare that in mind.”The S.H.I.E.L.D. uses as a device to fight other insect borne diseases shows its great potential as a protection against today’s biggest health risks."
Hamburg,Human Practices,Interview with Dr. Andrew Hammond,"In the course of our project, we had the great opportunity to interview Dr. Andrew Hammond, post-doctoral researcher at the Imperial College London in the field of malaria control through genetic-based technologies.Besides giving us a quick overview of the general functionalities of gene drive as a very promising approach to contain malaria, he also gave us an understanding of his substantial publications.“What a gene drive could do is, that it can spread [genetic modifications] in theory in the entire population, potentially cross whole sub-Saharan Africa. [...] It worked very well with Anopheles gambiae, which is the main vector of malaria in Africa. [...] Together with a couple of other closely related species [they] are responsible for about 95% of malaria transmission in the region. [...] In 2016 we showed, that we could spread this element through the population and [...] [the females] of the population got unable to reproduce. In theory, you could crash the whole population.”We debated the difficulties, which malaria researcher are recently facing as well as prevention methods. Furthermore, we discussed different aspects of our project intensively. Dr. Hammond gave us a lot of suggestions regarding the experimental design, especially in conducting mosquito experiments and testing our odours. He also gave us input for the decision, where to place our trap in the field. We agreed, that placing it close to possible breeding sites, such as stagnant freshwater or on the outside of houses by eaves, is not only reasonable but feasible as well.Finally, we came to the conclusion, that multiple approaches in combating the malaria-transmitting vectors are crucial to prevent Plasmodium falciparum from adapting to other vector species. This includes very focused approaches, e.g. gene drive, which targets Anopheles gambiae, the main vector in malaria, as well as broader approaches, which targets non-dominant vector species too.“I do not like looking at gene drive as “the” solution. I see it as a chance to get rid of the major vectors in the most affected areas. [...] I think the technology you are developing would be extremely useful in that case, when used in regions were this non-dominant vector species are present. At the same time with other vector control programs, it would be effective, because you do not give malaria enough time to adapt to other vector species. So you want to target a range of all these vector species all at once with a range of different tools, because if you rely on one tool and they become become resistant, we are in big trouble.”"
Hamburg,Human Practices, Interview and group discussion with Dr. Mirko Himmel,"Projects dealing with genetically modified organisms (GMO) offer a great chance to recreate living organisms in a novel way, opening new possibilities to address problems. However, taking advantage of these new opportunities comes with responsibility for the GMOs as well as for the environment. The big keywords here are biosafety and -security. While developing the S.H.I.E.L.D as a malaria prevention method this year, we used bacteria which were modified to sustain itself for a potentially indefinite amount of time while producing a neurotoxin. Regarding these two aspects of our project, biosafety was of great concern to us. To discuss the risk factors of our project with an expert, we invited Dr. Mirko Himmel from the Carl Friedrich von Weizäcker-Centre for Science and Peace Research. He holds a degree in biochemistry, with a specialisation in biological arms control and biosecurity matters today. He gave us a detailed introduction into biosafety and security focusing on the difficulty of Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC). This informative lecture was followed by an open discussion addressing potential issues in safety and security as well as possible solutions. Lastly, Dr. Himmel raised the topic of important and sensible precautions for lab work.The first major topic of the discussion was possible off-target organisms of the S.H.I.E.L.D. In the device we developed, the toxin produced by our bacterial culture is separated by a hydrogel from the environment. Due to this specific design, only animals that can sting this gel have access to the toxin and can suck it out. This prevents any other animals from getting in contact with the toxin while the trap is intact. Furthermore, the composition of attractants used in the S.H.I.E.L.D. are specifically designed to lure mosquitoes, reducing the chance other animals might fly into the trap.Under normal operating conditions, the GMOs are entrapped in our device. A nanofilter with pores small enough to prevent the E. coli from exiting and other microorganisms from entering the S.H.I.E.L.D. is placed between the hydrogel the mosquitoes land on and the dextran-based one from iGEM Eindhoven 2018 which contains E.coli. Nevertheless, there is a chance of exposure, for example in the case of severe damage, and escape safety needs to be considered. The bacteria we use are almost as fit as normal bacteria and they can sustain themselves over a long period of time. However, our implemented growth inhibition module is not only controlling cell size but also suppressing cell division, making it impossible for the bacteria to proliferate and spread even under ideal circumstances.  An additional suggestion was the introduction of a separate kill switch before using the S.H.I.E.L.D. in the field, such as the Amber substitution kill switch introduced by iGEM Darmstadt 2016. In this strain, a stop codon called Amber codon is introduced into a transcription factor which inhibits the expression of a lethal gene. In the S.H.I.E.L.D. the amino acid that corresponds to the Amber codon and does not naturally occur in E. coli would be provided by the cyanobacteria. In the absence of the amino acid the transcription factor would no longer be produced, causing the activation of the lethal gene.Another important topic was the selection of the insecticide used in the S.H.I.E.L.D. The data for the toxin we originally chose were not sufficient to ensure safe usage in the lab or the trap itself. Not only could the toxin be potentially harmful to off-target organisms in case of damage to the trap, but it might pose a health risk to people working with it in the lab. Dr. Himmel stressed that we would always have to assume higher concentrations of toxins when produced in the lab than could be observed in nature. Given that information, we were not able to state with certainty that working with the toxin would be in accordance with the safety regulations of a biosafety level 1 laboratory.As a consequence, we decided on an alternative insecticide, namely BjalT. It is a neurotoxic polypeptide derived from the Judean Black Scorpion which acts on voltage-gated sodium channels and most importantly, proven to be harmless to mammals.We also discussed the issue of modification and misuse of the trap for possible malicious purposes. One potential misuse addressed was the decantation of toxins that diffuse through the hydrogel. However, considering the small amount of toxin produced and the specificity of the toxin, this is not a concern. There are other possibilities to collect the toxin; one could try to cultivate the bacteria to produce bigger amounts of it, but the growth inhibition module and the co-culture with the cyanobacteria make it hard to culture them to larger populations if isolated. Moreover, there is the risk of misuse of the device as a bioweapon or to kill animals besides mosquitos, for example bees, by replacing the toxin. For this to work, though, an individual would need great expertise as the multiple aspects of the trap would have to be changed. Not only would the hardware design needed to be altered, but one would have to exchange the toxin and eliminate the growth inhibition.To further increase the effort needed to misuse the trap we decided to post sensible information about the method of toxin production only on the iGEM website, rather than spread it on social media.We discussed testing our odour baits and toxin on Anopheles gambiae, the main vector of plasmodium falciparum. We worked with mosquitoes that were not infected and thus harmless to humans. All the experiments involving mosquitoes took place in the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine. Dr. Thomas Jacobs, who supervised our work, was also able to answer questions that remained unanswered during our discussion with Dr. Himmel. Namely, whether or not one could expect the occurrence of a resistance to our toxin and the possibility of pathogens growing on the hydrogel."
Hamburg,Human Practices, ,"As we would not want the S.H.I.E.L.D. to depend on antibiotics, we discussed the necessity to introduce the DNA stably into the bacterial genome rather than working with plasmids as we currently do.At a later point in our project we visited Dr. Himmel again, updating him on our progress and improvements we made after our group talk."
Hamburg,Human Practices,Interview with Dr. Thomas Jacobs,"Towards the end of our project we had the chance to work in the laboratories of the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNI) where we conducted experiments on mosquitoes to test our hydrogel as well as the bait and toxin. Before we started working in the lab we talked to Dr. Thomas Jacobs of the BNI to gain knowledge about the malaria-transmitting vectors and to discuss some safety concerns raised during discussion with Dr. Mirko Himmel.He gave us more detailed information on the seasonality of the mosquitoes and talked about successes and difficulties of vector control both in Africa and Germany.He was able to diffuse our concerns that different pathogens might grow in our trap and could thereby be distributed by mosquitoes.  “No, I think this is for me very unlikely […] I would not expect that you have living pathogens on the trap’s surfaces for a very long time.”Another major concern of ours was the occurrence of resistances to the insecticide we are using.“Well, I think the toxin should be effective. I would not expect any development of resistance because normally they should not see this kind of toxin.”He stressed the importance of a dose high enough to swiftly kill the mosquitoes so there would be no sufficient time for them develop and pass on a resistance."
HebrewU,Human Practices,Regulation and global aspects,"Setting aside the ubiquitous nature of Dioxin pollution and specific tragedies that occurred (such as Agent Orange), we found that these types of pollutants are considered a current health hazard in many developing countries that have not installed legitimate regulatory constructs to prevent Dioxin creation or exposure. Among them, and some developed countries as well, there are also countries that may have taken the step to write laws [to prevent this from happening], but do not enforce those laws, or simply don't perform inspections.

Hong Kong HKUST,Integrated Human Practices,1. Motivation,"
Environmental pollution by plastics has long been an issue of concern across the globe. According to National Geographic, an astounding 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic have been produced and accumulated since its introduction in the 1950s. Triggered by the disturbing facts of plastic accumulation, the world has come up with many solutions to tackle this problem, for example by degrading PET. But there has been no defined solution to tackle Polyethylene, one of the most common plastics, as of yet. The HKUST iGEM team hopes to solve this issue by degrading PE and turning it into useful resources for everyone.
"
Hong Kong HKUST,Integrated Human Practices,2. Choosing Polyethylene as our Plastic Substrate,"
 Through doing more secondary research from the World Wildlife Fund and ScienceDirect, we identified Polyethyelene (PE) as one of the most prevalent sources of plastic pollution and yet seems to be one of the toughest kinds to eliminate. Plastic bags made out of PE take up the largest percentage of marine debris (90% of all floating marine debris), which caused major damage to aquatic life. On the other hand, people have found it extremely hard to degrade PE, as it is essentially made up of a long hydrocarbon chain with no chemical groups for enzymes to recognize and digest. It has also proven to be very resistant to chemical attacks. In 2015, the Hong Kong government imposed a levy scheme on PE plastic bags in order to minimize its environmental impacts. Nonetheless, some plastic bag use remains, along with past wastes which wound up in landfills, waiting for millennia to be decomposed. As such, our team is committed to tackle this problem and help fulfil Hong Kong government's vision of a cleaner Hong Kong using our genetic constructs to degrade PE.
"
Hong Kong HKUST,Integrated Human Practices,3. Taking it a Step Further -  Converting Waste to Electricity,"
Our team realized, however, that simply degrading polyethylene would produce fragmented alkanes, which could potentially be harmful to the environment as well. 
We wanted to turn this problem into an opportunity by using our end product to potentially solve yet another environmental issue. We realized that energy security is another pressing issue which countries face.
To solve these two problems simultaneously, we aim to convert the degraded plastics into electricity by feeding them as an energy source for an electricity-producing strain of bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Plastic degradation and electricity generation will be merged together in a Microbial Fuel Cell as described in our MFC design.

Hong Kong HKUST,Integrated Human Practices,"4. How Talking to Prof. Bookhart, an Environment and Sustainability Expert, Changed our Project Design","
To better mold our project into addressing genuine environmental concerns, we consulted Professor Davis Bookhart, the head of the HKUST Environment and Sustainability Department, who is currently working on different projects to reduce the University’s environmental impacts while addressing and managing risks that arise from climate change and resource scarcities. We thought that he would be able to give us more insights on real/current environmental challenges which we could help solve and how we could ensure the sustainability of our production system. 

 We first presented our system to Professor Bookhart in July. A few concerns he had was that, from the perspective of sustainability, our project was actually converting PE, a carbon-containing pollutant, into CO2 through the respiration of Shewanella, which in itself ıs a greenhouse gas. This actually exacerbates the problem of global warming despite removing a terrestrial and marine pollutant. Instead, Prof. Bookhart suggested that we find a way to reuse the carbon in any way or to feed back into the system for more electricity generation. We can also sequester the CO2 in a way that the CO2 is converted to a solid or a liquid to be stored.   

Prof. Bookhart had also asked about the threshold of electricity we expected to generate and how that electricity could be used. To really transform our project into an impactful product, we should implement an application for the electricity generated. We should as well focus on designing a device that could encourage the public to put their plastic waste to good use by generating electricity for daily use.

Hong Kong HKUST,Integrated Human Practices,5.  More Insights – Meetup with iGEM teams in the environmental track ,"
During our meetups with other iGEM teams for collaboration, we exchanged ideas with team HKJS_S and realized that their project mechanism could be implemented into our system to tackle the concern of CO2 by-product waste raised by Prof. Bookhart. 

One of their parts encodes a nitrogenase, which has the ability to transform CO2 into methane. Both substrates were intimately linked with our project: the CO2 was the sustainability problem we had to tackle, while methane was a substrate that could be processed by our Alkane Metabolism pathway. Seeing this connection, we asked for their permission to borrow their construct design to improve our system overall. 

Originally, we meant to use E. coli bacteria to secrete laccase for PE plastic degradation and Shewanella, stored in the MFC, to house the alkane channel and alkane metabolism pathway. However, to integrate insights from both Professor Bookhart and the HKJS_S team, we decided to change our final system design into one single Bacterial Artificial Chromosome, so that our individual systems could be housed in one single cell to increase the automation of our project. This modification will be implemented upon successful attempts on PE degradation and Alkane metabolism. The new schematic is as follows:


As usual, laccase degrades PE into alkanes (refer to our PE degredation page for details). The AlkL gene (coding for Alkane outer membrane channel protein) allows larger alkanes to enter the transformed Shewanella and the ASS cluster allows the cell to process it (please see our Alkane metabolism page for details). In addition, we added a nitrogenase gene to convert the CO2 products into methane. The idea is that since methane can also be processed by the ASS cluster, CO2 produced by Shewanella during respiration can be recycled into the MFC system. 

According to our modelling, carbon dioxide can be converted into methane after undergoing reduction process, in which the molecule uses the energy from the sun/catalyst to break up the CO2 molecule into carbon and oxygen atoms, then combine with hydrogen to form methane and water, as explained on the chemical equation below.

Using irreversible Henri-Michaelis-Menten Kinetics, we tried to consolidate an enzyme-catalyzed reaction with a single reaction and and reaction rate equation with Vmax of 0.8 ± 0.07 nmol/min and a Km for CO2 of 23.3 ± 3.7 mM [1].

From this graph, it can be seen that it takes over 3 hours to fully convert 10 nmol of CO2 into methane. It appears to verify that common features of homogeneous catalysts for CO2 reduction to CH4 are low reaction rates (e.g., turnover frequencies) and limited number of turnovers (e.g., turnover number) before inactivation of the catalyst [2].

Since laccase takes about 80 days to degrade about 40% of the sample PE, we will also consider integrating a delay module into the alkane metabolism module, inspired by the iGEM team of HKUST 2017. The idea is that the alkane channel and alkane processing proteins will only kick into effect after 80 days of PE breakdown, so as to save cellular resources. The time delay module will be enabled by the phlF inducer, which induces the pHLFp promoter in front of the alkane metabolism genes. Since the genes have a lower RBS strength than that used by the phlF inducer gene, this will create a time delay when producing the alkane metabolism proteins.

Hong Kong HKUST,Integrated Human Practices,6. Primary market research: Listening to our potential users,"
One of the aims of our public engagement and education exhibition was to find out the major concerns of the general public in choosing sources of renewable energy. This will help us to choose the focus and design our MFC to better suit the public’s concerns and aid in a more user-friendly design. The detailed analysis of our collected data can be found 
here

The results show that “impacts on human health” and “constraints in the conditions/ requirements for energy production” are the public’s major concerns. There are also concerns with the release of environmental pollutants such as sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid during the production of renewable energy generators. However, survey results show that the public had regarded this issue as less important as the long-term generation of renewable energies are comparatively cleaner than energies from fossil fuels where there are no chemical pollutants generated during energy production. Upon reviewing our MFC system design, the release of CO2 from our MFC will be produced as a by-product during electricity generation, this greenhouse gas, therefore, will still be a pressing issue that the team needs to tackle. Involving the public engagement results into our MFC design, we have set the following design standards/requirements for our MFC:
1. Limit the impacts on human health by limiting users’ interaction with the inner mechanism of our Laccase degradation and MFC system. Chemicals and cell culturing medium should not be harmful to both the environment and humans. This can be done by making the MFC a closed system during operation, where the users need not manually operate the system at any intermediate stage. 

2. Focus on reusing or fixing the CO2 that will be released from the respiration of our cell culture to minimize environmental pollution. 

3. The size of the MFC should be scaled up to accommodate the slow PE plastic degradation rate.
"
Hong Kong HKUST,Integrated Human Practices,7. Finalising our ideas – Final wrap-up with Prof. Davis Bookhart ,"
 After making the mentioned modifications to our system, we again approached Prof. Bookhart to update him with our progress and to show him the data we collected. We asked for further advice on how to integrate the public opinion we obtained to help define our future direction with the project. Prof. Bookhart ’s main concern still lied in the fact that CO2 was our end product. He commented that our added nitrogenase system would only delay the problem of CO2 release by recycling it, instead of trapping it permanently. 

Integrating all the concerns and suggestions given by Prof. Bookhart and our market research during our exhibition, we came up with the biosphere-MFC conjugation and the nitrogenase system to fully sequester CO2. 

For the former, we will let CO2 pass from the anode chamber that houses Shewanella into an adjoining compartment via a semipermeable membrane. This adjoining compartment will house a self-contained biosphere, where plants, shrimp and potentially fish can be kept. The plants inside can take up the CO2 that crosses over via photosynthesis,  hence fixing the CO2 and therefore sequestering it as plant biomass. This will help decompose PE without releasing additional CO2 to solve the issue raised by Professor Bookhart. Since the nitrogenase system does not trap the CO2 permanently, it was not suggested to be the primary way to solve the sustainability issue. Nonetheless, our team decided to keep this system, to enhance our electricity generation when the plastic degradation process is limited.

Alongside carbon sequestration, there is an added benefit of putting plants near the MFC: to absorb any excess copper ions (Cu+) from our PE degradation module (which role is to enhance laccase enzymatic activity). This will nourish the biosphere and also prevent copper ions contamination to the environment.

All in all, our final product design is modified into an MFC/biosphere conjugation. We hope that the mini-ecosystem can serve as a visual attractant to educate people on the idea of sustainability and also to motivate them to be more environmentally friendly. In addition to educating the public and raising awareness towards the environment, this MFC/biosphere conjugation could generate enough electricity to charge a power pack, through the help of a capacitor. On a small scale, it could be used in households to charge batteries or power packs for electrical devices. While on a large scale, the MFC/biosphere conjugation could be used in malls to serve as a charging station as well as a mini aquarium or terrarium to be exhibited.

Hong Kong HKUST,Education and Engagement,Synthetic Biology Exhibition during the  HKUST Information Day,"Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is considered as a type of renewable bioenergy that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy. However, microbial fuel cells still pose advantages and disadvantages like other types of renewable energies. In order to minimize the disadvantages and to make MFC a best-suited renewable energy source for Hong Kong, the HKUST team tries to bring the idea of MFC to the public and raise further discussions for improvement of our design. We did this by organizing an exhibition booth during the HKUST Information Day with the following aims:
The university's information day aimed to provide undergraduate admission information for high school students from all over Hong Kong. Visitors in this events, therefore, mainly consist of senior high school students and their parents with the urge to find out more information about our university and the programs offered. We took this opportunity to conduct our public engagement and education for potential high school students to learn more about synthetic biology and will one day join us to improve our society. 
To enhance active engagement, we have used 3D DNA and plasmid models to introduce the basic concepts of DNA as a coding tool for all living organisms and how recombinant technologies can combine functions of different organisms for the benefits of humans and the environment. Students were able to enhance their knowledge through hands-on trials of finding complementary sticky ends in individual plasmids and combines parts together by “ligation”. A mini-game of “How to build your own MFC” was also introduced to test the public’s understanding of our project after our thorough demonstration and explanations using posters and real models.

Poster shown in the exhibition:

Other than public education on synthetic biology and MFC as a renewable energy, this exhibition also serves the purpose of initiating discussions and collect opinions through our survey on concerns that the public has when choosing renewable energy. Results from this survey will be used for the team to prioritize the area of focus for our MFC improvement. 

When designing our survey, we have considered the fact that most of the public involved in the survey do not have the same level of knowledge of renewable energy. Therefore, our survey is designed such that it includes,

"
Hong Kong HKUST,Education and Engagement,Analysis of survey findings,"To facilitate data analysis, choices of concerns provided in part 1 and part 2 of our survey was grouped into the following categories:


Figure 1 shows a stacked bar chart comparing the total average points of importance that the general public of different age group gave when considering each category of concerns when choosing renewable energy. The brown toned stacks show grouped data of answers before
 the video while the green toned stacks summarized data after our team’s introduction video. 

In general, all 4 areas of concerns shows differences before and after the video with ‘health impacts’ and ‘production constraints’ showing an increase in importance under the public’s perception, while the ‘environmental damage’ and ‘social cost’ show a decrease in importance. Since the function of our video in between the parts are aimed to educate the viewers about different types of renewable energies, it suggests that these differences can be influenced by education outside classes, implying that there can be a significant shift in society's concerns and interests in certain renewable energy source when they are exposed to the new or updated information about renewable energy and, therefore, show that there is a need for public education in this area. However, there are also possibilities that these differences are purely due to the fact that there are views to the issues that the public did not originally consider.


Factors in Fig. 2 are grouped according to the following:

When expanding the different limitations each renewable energy poses, Fig.2 shows that impacts on human health are still considered the most important when choosing renewable energy. Impacts on human health that renewable energy might potentially cause are the low-frequency waves caused by the wind turbines in wind farms or the toxic and carcinogenic chemicals released during the manufacturing processes. This shows that impacts on human health should be our top priority when modifying our MFC.

Production constraints are the second most important category after we have shown the video. However, the only factor that can be related to our MFC is the low production yield which we think is beyond the scope in which we can improve during the time span of this iGEM season. As a result, the next focus on our MFC moderation will be on the possible pollutants that the MFC might produce during its electricity generation. We have identified that CO2 is the only greenhouse gas pollutant that will be released from our system. The modification of this will be discussed in the integrated human practices section of this project.

Amongst all the other choices, the social cost including the ethical issues on crop usage and land use seems to be relatively less important as Hong Kong have alternatives to these issues such as using kitchen waste as energy source instead of growing new crops for bioenergy or using offshore wind farm as an alternative to wind farms on land. As a result, the scale of our MFC system can have more flexibility than what we have originally thought to be limited due to the limiting living space available in Hong Kong.

Summarizing all the valuable feedbacks from our potential users and the different aspects of our project, we have arrived to the following conclusion:
"
Hong Kong-CUHK,HUMAN PRACTICES,Human Practice ,
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Overview,"At the onset, PhageShift may appear to be a pure scientific endeavor, comprising of just experiments and results. However, a closer look would reveal the critical role our Human Practices played in shaping our project, from the very beginning, till the fine tuning stage at the end. Throughout the duration of our project, we were committed to communicating our work to diverse sections in a manner that have maximum impact, as well as keeping an open mind about bacteriophages and taking inputs from stakeholders and experts and incorporating it in our project. Antibiotic resistance is a looming problem globally, and there have been multiple reports on how underdeveloped and developing countries like would be the worst affected. India is one of the largest consumers of antibiotics, and despite regulations, the problem of easy availability and overuse in medical and poultry industries has contributed to the increasing appearance of resistant strains. We decided to play an active role in educating the public on what the consequences of antibiotic resistance may be, and how one can help by being a responsible consumer. Bacteriophages are a group of viruses that infect bacteria. To a large section of the society, the term ""virus"" carries a negative connotation which they associate with infections and biological weapons. This highlighted to us the need to educate the general public on what
    		phages are, and how they have a potential role to play in therapeutics. At the same time, there is a lot of skepticism in the scientific and medical commmunity on phage therapy. This compelled us to investigate and evaluate the viability of our project idea, and to ensure our Human Practices endeavours are carried out in a responsible manner which does not glorify phage therapy as a panacea.  Motivated with the above challenges, we undertook the following activities for our Human Practices. Each of these are explained in detail in our Integrated Human Practices  and Public engagement  pages.
        "
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Crowdfunding,"Funding is one of the first and crucial aspects of any project, as often, the direction a project takes is determined by the funds available. Our crowdfunding inititatives involved us being actively involved on social media, inviting questions on our project and explaining our plans in a manner that was simple to understand. Our efforts bore fruit, as we raised Rs. 2,57,810 (~3700 USD)! "
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Developing a project idea,"We started our brainstorming sessions by deciding to look for real world problems that we can harness synthetic biology to solve, and thus, our idea to improve phage therapy to tackle antibiotic resistance grew out of a newspaper article!"
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Survey,"To understand how antibiotics are used in India, as well as to gauge the general perception of phage therapy, we sent out a survey dealing with these two topics to a wide group. We received nearly 200 responses (half of them from medical professionals) which helped us improve our understanding of the problem. We sought to address some of the concerns as part of our project."
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Meeting stakeholders,"Our project has a direct impact on the medical community, and thus it was important to understand their concerns with antibiotics and phage therapy. We spoke to doctors on the problems faced by antibiotics, and analysed whether phage therapy would face a similar challenge. One important issue which stood out was endotoxin release common to both forms of treatment, and this inspired us to design PAIR, a novel improvement in phage therapy to minimize endotoxin release. We also held an interview with doctors on this. We also met with GangaGen, a biotechnology startup in Bangalore who had worked on lysis-deficient phages and hold two patents related to it. Their insight on our project and working with phages was very helpful for us, especially as we were handling them for the first time."
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Conversations,"To promote awareness on antibiotic resistance, we designed a brochure in English and the local language Kannada on what antibiotic resistance is, how it arose and what alternatives there are. Then, we went to some popular spots in Bangalore and spoke to the people there and gave them our pamphlet to ponder upon. The people were very receptive, and this was a healthy dose of motivation!"
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Review of laws,"Phage therapy is largely disallowed in most parts of the world, except a few Eastern Europe countries. With rising cases of AMR infections, we felt it was important to provide the starting point for a conversation on the legal status of phage therapy. We reviewed clinical trials and compared laws on them in various parts of the globe, to help policymakers and interested stakeholders gain a better understanding of the subject. We are in the process of publishing our review, and are drafting a legal document on it which will be submitted to the authorities."
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Giving talks,"India has a mere 137 researchers per million inhabitants, which is very low in comparison to countries like Brazil (694 per million), China (1071 per million), USA (4663 per million). This statistic prompted us to encourage scientific temper in school students, and let them know the joys of research and how they can get involved (the iGEM High School competition for example!). We gave talks in 6 schools in all, speaking to an audience of nearly 300 young minds, and their bubbling enthusiasm was very infectious."
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Publishing a book,"The technical details of scientific projects often bores the layman. In an effort to educate the public on the consequences of antibiotic resistance, we got together and wrote 7 fictional short stories set in a post antibiotic world. After speaking to our Institute publication house, IIScPress, we are very happy to share that our book, ""Resistance: Tales from a post-antibiotic world"" has been accepted for publication and will soon be available for everyone to read! We are also in the process of translating it to the local language Kannada, and distributing a free copy in libraries in an effort to reach more people."
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Poster Presentation," As hosts of the All India iGEM meetup, we decided to keep the last session of Poster Presentation open to everyone with the consent of the participating teams. This enabled many university students, from undergraduate to post-graduates, to look at all the iGEM projects and learn about them, while also helping teams prepare themselves to speak to audiences of varying technical knowledge."
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Guidelines on working with phages," PhageShift was the first time all members of the team had worked with bacteriophages. While we had wonderful support from our mentors and PIs, we still faced plenty of difficulties due to insufficient documentation of previous phage research as well as lack of clear guidelines. To ensure future teams do not face similar difficulties, we prepared an extensively documented guideline with images of our results that should help future iGEM teams and phage researchers to overcome the initial hurdles of working with a new system."
IISc-Bangalore,Human Practices,Youtube mini-series," We created a series of mini videos explaining antibiotic resistance and bacteriophages to help the public understand these topics in a simple manner. Without being too technical, these videos were aimed to provide a starting point for anyone to learn the terms we use throughout our project."
IISc-Bangalore,Integrated HP,Overview,"Antibiotic resistance is a global challenge, and proposing a solution to it via improvement in phage therapy which is still not completely understood presented to us a tricky situation which required considerable thought and discussion. The motivation which led PhageShift to take its current form came from our active outreach and dialogue with the community. Human Practices was thus an integral part of PhageShift, from the very beginning, till the very end!"
IISc-Bangalore,Integrated HP,Searching for problems," India is the second most populous country, and as a developing country, it faces several challenges on a wide variety of issues. We held discussions within the team and with our PIs, and decided that our project idea would be on utilizing synthetic biology to solve such a real-world challenge. We implemented this decision in a unique way; our brainstorming sessions involved discussions on news articles and social issues, and prospective synbio based solutions to them! This helped us in multiple ways. Apart from providing a starting point to think of solutions and experiments, it also helped us visualize how Human Practices, software, hardware and various other aspects of the iGEM project could be built around a particular social issue. On January 30, a report by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism bought to light how usage of antibiotics, particularly the last-resort drug colistin, in the poultry industry as weight boosters was playing a major role in contribution of worldwide drug resistance and warned of emergence of superbugs [1]. This was picked up by several newspapers which brought it to our attention. This provided the seed for us to read more about colistin resistance, and to see what we could do to tackle it. We then learned about the mobilized colistin resistance (MCR-1) gene, which confers plasmid-mediated resistance to colistin[2]. Since it can be horizontally transferred between different strains of bacteria, it poses a serious threat in rendering the last-hope antibiotic colistin obsolete. The mechanism of resistance is through the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A in the cell membrane, which decreases the affinity of colistin for lipid A and thus lowers the antimicrobial activity of the drug. We decided to look into alternatives to antibiotics, and on reading about phage therapy, we planned out how bacteriophages could be improved to exploit antibiotic resistance. And thus, on this note our project idea of PhageShift began, with a special emphasis on colistin resistance via PACMAN.
                "
IISc-Bangalore,Integrated HP,Survey to gauge perception,"As we read further about the causes of antibiotic resistance in India, it was clear that the problem was the rampant misuse in the medical and poultry sectors [2][3]. To know more about how aware the Indian population was on antibiotics and phage therapy, we decided to conduct a survey that would also be helpful in identifying key concerns which people would have with bacteriophages. The reason this was important was that bacteriophages are viruses, and viruses have a very negative connotation for a large part of the populace who associate them diseases and danger. The questions were designed keeping iGEM's advice on scientific surveys in mind, and we put out the survey for the general public to fill, and especially invited many doctors and healthcare professionals to participate in it.The survey saw 193 responses, 93 of whom were in the medical profession. Some had over 15+ years of experience, and some more were just starting out. 34 responders were involved in scientific research and another 64 said they were in professions besides medicine and research (including students). The diversity and number of responses helped us greatly in assessing the viewpoints of a broad community whom we identified as stakeholders in our project. Our survey report summarises our findings, and how we intended to take it forward. Two things emerged from the survey that had a large impact on our project. Firstly, that lot of people were unaware about phage therapy, and among those who had heard of it, there was a significant concern about the effects of using phages would have on our bodies. Secondly, that cases of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections were clearly on a rise, which we could correlate to the higher than average antibiotic consumption in India. This prompted us to develop a series of videos which explained briefly what phages were and how they affect bacteria, as well as increase awareness on the consequences of misuse of antibiotics.
                    "
IISc-Bangalore,Integrated HP,How PAIR came to be,"To further explore the role of PhageShift in therapeutics, we sought to understand what are the challenges that antibiotics faced in the last few decades as the primary form of treatment of bacterial infections. We studied articles and clinical cases that brought some of these points forth. Among them, the one that stood out to us was the problem of endotoxin release due to antibiotic-induced lysis of gram-negative bacterial cell membrane, which has severe consequences in patients with multi-organ failure (MOFs) and low immunity[4]. Inflammation is also a problem in young patients especially.At this stage, it was important for us to understand the real-life consequences of antibiotic usage which was happening around us. We visited and interacted with doctors in our institute's Health Center and then contacted medical professionals in nearby hospitals, and spoke to them on what and how severe the problem of antibiotic-induced endotoxin release was. We also sought their views on phage therapy and antibiotic resistance. They were very encouraging of our project, and talked about the process leading to endotoxin release. It was clear to us that this problem would not go away even in phage therapy, as the process of bacterial lysis remained.

                     Motivated to tackle this, we studied the ability of our body's natural immune cells in getting rid of bacteria and found out that the endotoxin release here was considerably lesser. We then spoke to Prof. Dipshika Chakravortty in the Microbiology and Cell Biology department of IISc, who has worked on molecular pathology and immunology to know more about this. Equipped with this understanding, and inspired to ensure phage therapy would not contribute to the problem of endotoxin release, we designed PAIR, the second component of our project. Later on, we interviewed Dr. Nirmala (IISc Health Center) and Dr. Abhishek Bhalerao (Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital) on a host of issues ranging from antibiotic resistance in India, phage therapy, endotoxin release etc. and the interview is available on our Youtube channel.

                        "
IISc-Bangalore,Integrated HP,Speaking with GangaGen and researchers,"The idea of PAIR was to use lysis deficient phages to recruit the body's immune cells to clear bacteria which would help treat the infection while minimizing endotoxin release. To know more about lysis deficient phages, we visited GangaGen, a biotechnology startup in Bangalore which has two patents on this and is India's leading company on phage research. It also presented to us an opportunity to know more about the rules which govern the development of new therapeutic agents.This meeting proved to be highly informative, as we learned about the work GangaGen did on phages, and they were very kind in listening to our idea and providing valuable inputs. Among other things, they talked to us about how the overcoming of phage resistance in APES was unlikely (which we later proved through our modeling ), discussed the feasibility of our PAIR and PACMAN ideas, and gave some helpful tips on working with phages. They spoke about the lengthy process of getting a medicine approved which helped us realize the impact of our project on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, and how one of the problems with phage therapy is the uncertain dosage for safe, therapeutic action. We took the idea of dosage forward by carrying out experiments on the MIC for bacterial lysis.We also sought to incorporate feedback from scientific researchers, another community we identified as a stakeholder in our work. To achieve this, we discussed our ideas with Prof. Ry Young (Texas A&M University), and Prof. Venigalla B. Rao (Catholic University of America), both of whom are well-known names in bacteriophage research. We discussed our PAIR idea with Prof. Ry Young, a pioneer in lysis deficient phages. We had planned a fourth component of the project, called CARE (CRISPR-cas9 assisted Resistance Elimination), where we aimed to deliver Crispr-cas9 system into the pathogen using a phage. However, Prof. Rao pointed out that ~500 bp is the maximum sequence length that can be added to the T4 genome safely without any encountering problems in packaging. Considering this, we decided not to pursue CARE further. "
IISc-Bangalore,Integrated HP,Motivation to review laws,"Our meeting with GangaGen made us curious about the regulations which govern topics such as antibiotic resistance and phage therapy, and whether we were complying with the framework in our proposal of PAIR, PACMAN, and APES. We comprehensively read the ""Scoping Report on Antimicrobial Resistance in India"" prepared for the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India, and Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) by the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, India (CDDEP).

                    To our surprise, we found no legal guidelines on working with phages, and what the legal status of phage therapy in India is. We contacted CRI Kasauli, India's only government-funded lab which is allowed to do bacteriophage testing. We then reviewed the Drug and Cosmetics Act, 1940 which governs the manufacturing and sale of drugs in India, to see how they apply to phages. This was in stark comparison to Eastern European countries where there are clear laws on phage therapy, and the USA, where the Food and Drug Administration has cleared clinical trials. This provided the spark for us to prepare a comprehensive review of phage therapy in the Indian context. This review has been described in our public engagement page. "

IISc-Bangalore,Public Engagement,Overview and Motivation,"The basis of our project, PhageShift, was rooted in tackling a very real problem that is only now gaining momentum worldwide – antibiotic resistance. Rather than concocting sketchy real life applications to some ingenious brainwave conceived in a lab, we looked outward for the problem. Indeed, as our Integrated Human Practices page  shows, our project was developed with interaction and input from various agencies and stakeholders, after we stumbled across the threats antimicrobial resistance is posing.Thus, our interactions not only gave us direction vis-a-vis the technical part of the project but also afforded insight into the worldly concerns regarding this. Education and public engagement on antimicrobial resistance and phage therapy was not just another component to our project; it was a necessity arising out of the problems we chose to focus on. Treating it with the importance it deserves, we thus carried out several activities with the dual intention of increasing awareness on antibiotic resistance and initiating a public dialogue on phage therapy."
IISc-Bangalore,Public Engagement,Crowdfunding,"As our idea shaped into a planned project, we began planning on collecting funds for our project. Apart from reaching out to sponsors and other organizations for funds, we also set up a crowdfunding in which we talked about our motivation for the project and highlighted the issues of AMR and how our project PhageShift aimed to improve the conditions which surround phage therapy. To promote our crowdfunding page, we participated in various discussions on social media in an ""Ask-me-anything"" style. This prompted some fun and wonderful discussions on the various aspects of our project. We reached out to our institute's alumni as well as members of the general public, and we were extremely grateful to the kindness and belief that people showed in us, as we raised over 3600$ in a span of two months. This constituted a significant percentage of the total funds we raised, and we strived to spend these funds in a thoughtful and transparent manner."
IISc-Bangalore,Public Engagement,Survey,"Before we begin to engage the public, it was important to know the public! An initiative that played a crucial role in our project, the survey formed the basis of many of the subsequent activities that we took up. The survey, its conclusions as well as the influence in the project have been discussed in detail on our  Survey page."
IISc-Bangalore,Public Engagement,Speaking to young minds,"The future of the world is in the hands of the youth. Our team members felt that antibiotic resistance, being this concerning a topic, must be something that must be brought to the attention of the youth. Therefore, we set out with quirky and fun presentations to high schools where students and potential scientists were educated on antimicrobial resistance via abuse of antibiotics, ways to tackle AMRs, including nanomaterials and phages, and their potential use in the medical industries and were also given a picture on how careers in science go. They were also encouraged to learn more about synthetic biology and to use opportunities like iGEM High School. Discussions, focussing on the topics of the talk, were conducted after the talk between the students, and even the teachers. These talks were organized in the following high schools: R.V. Pre University College - Bengaluru, Bhavan's Vidya Mandir - Elamakkara, TKM Centenary Public School - Kollam, Deeksha Center for Learning PU College - Bengaluru, Delhi Public School - Bangalore South, AECS Magnolia Maaruti Public School - Bengaluru. Their infectious enthusiasm and simple yet profound questions left us both motivated in our project, and wondering about how many more minds there were that just needed a small spark in their imagination and creativity that would help them utilise their talents better. We also heard very kind words from the teachers of the schools we visited, who wished us the best in our project and all the activities we undertook to explain antibiotic resistance.

        "
IISc-Bangalore,Public Engagement,Pamphlet distribution,"The need of the hour to tackle antibiotic resistance is better consumer awareness. The World Health Organization in 2015 released the findings of their multi country survey on antibiotic resistance, which shows that even if people have heard of it, there is still widespread misunderstanding of the issue.[1].
           To improve the public understanding of the issue, we designed pamphlets explaining antibiotics, its abuse in domestic as well as industrial (medical, agricultural, poultry) spheres, on AMR and alternatives to antibiotics. They were also translated to the local language, Kannada, to broaden their reach. The designs are available in English (Front and Back) and Kannada (Front and Back) for anyone to freely use.They were then distributed at the Visveswaraya Industrial and Technological Museum, near Cubbon Park (both hotspots of Bangalore city). A poster containing similar information was put up and throughout the day: young and old, staff and visitors alike, were all were given the pamphlets along with generic instructions, such as always completing a course of antibiotics once prescribed, to avoid arbitrary self-dosage of antibiotics and the like.Both locations are being prime hubs of public activity  and are thus also major tourist attractions. We could therefore speak to people of various nationalities who took a keen interest in what we had to say, and even took back multiple copies of the pamphlets to spread awareness back home.However, the most impactful session the team members had was with around ~80 high school students of a government school, Lokpal Vidya Mandira who were there on an educational field trip. Most of the students were from an underprivileged background and had zero knowledge regarding antibiotics previously; more importantly, they all said that they had left courses of antibiotics midway, because they “would feel better 2-3 days into the course and saw no point in completing it”. More alarmingly, their parents, having no knowledge of this themselves, would egg them on to do this, even force them to, as “tablets are expensive” and they would therefore “always only buy half the number of pills the doctor tells you to, it is enough to get better”.To say it was an interesting interaction would be an understatement. We understood the conditions that led to the working class to misuse antibiotics - the pills were too expensive and gave an illusion of being cured midway through the course, encouraging them to drop it midway. Also, a general impression of antibiotics being “magical” and “miraculous” “Western medicine” (as opposed to the indigenous medicine) persists among them - possibly a colonial hangover. Due to this, every time they fall sick, they indiscriminately pop an antibiotic with utter faith that it will cure them. This is only worsened by under qualified doctors who, just as indiscriminately, prescribe the drugs.Thus, not only is the frequency of usage unnecessarily high, the courses are also not completed properly. The conditions are literally tailor-made to foster antimicrobial resistance. Knowledge is the only cure to this malaise of ignorance and fear. The children after listening to us, promised to show their parents and their neighbours the pamphlets, relay what we told them and swore to not misuse antibiotics again.Moreover, their child-like curiosity prompted many questions about phage therapy and the nature of antibiotic resistance and genetic engineering. We therefore spoke to their teachers about different scholarship schemes offered by the government and institutes for meritorious students. We sincerely hope we could light a spark for science in the minds of those kindred naive that day."
IISc-Bangalore,Public Engagement,Legal Framework Review," We studied current antibiotic and phage therapy laws and learnt of ways citizens could submit proposals to the government, regarding policy change. India currently has no legislation at all with regard to phage therapy specifically. In fact, the Indian legal framework with respect to therapeutics and pharmaceuticals as a whole, is not very well developed.  Thus, upon extensive analysis and comparison with other policies prevalent in other countries such as Georgia, Russia and Poland, regarding phage therapy, we attempted to draft a proposal to the Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. This was under their Grant-In-Aid Scheme. However, to be clear, at no point was the intention to obtain a grant for PhageShift. However, upon meeting with the Department of Science and Technology, Centre for Policy Research, IISc Bangalore, we came to know that lobbying for such a change in policy would be an extremely long drawn process. As we were not in a position to commit to such a protracted affair, we decided that it would be better to rework our draft for policy change into a scholarly article. We are proud to say that we were drafred a manuscript and submitted it to a journal, and are now awaiting review!"
IISc-Bangalore,Public Engagement,Video series," As a crowdfunded project and as students of an tax-funded institute, we found it compelling to ensure that our project is accessible to each and everyone who wishes to know more about it. The essence of a project lies in its details, where even the most persevering can get lost due to difficulties in following the technical terms. With this motivation as well as making simple introductory videos on bacteriophages, we created a 5 part mini series and made it available on YouTube under a Creative Commons license. The short videos are on topics like ""Introduction to Bacteriophages"",""Antibiotic Resistance"", ""Genetic Recombination"", ""Plaque Assay"" and ""T4 injection mechanism"", which we thought would be highly useful in understanding our project. The first of the 5 part series is available here. Our interview  with Dr. Nirmala and Dr. Abhishek which helped develop PAIR are also publicly available on our Youtube channel."
IISc-Bangalore,Public Engagement,Poster Presentation," As organizers of the All India iGEM meetup, we decided to keep the final poster presentation session open to everyone. The aim was to engage people on what iGEM is, what projects undergraduates work on, as well as provide teams with an opportunity to explain their project to a large audience with varying background knowledge, to replicate a Jamboree like environment. In the open-to-all Research Showcase, we interacted with young school children and answered their questions on whether phage is the hero and bacteria is the villain, as well as answered accomplished researchers on what our control for the experiment was!"
IISc-Bangalore,Public Engagement,Resistance - Tales from a Post Antibiotic World,"It was essential that one realises antibiotic resistance is a real problem with real consequences and that it can disrupt our daily life, in more ways than we know, quicker than we can imagine. What better way than to write an anthology of fictional stories, set in a post-antibiotic world? Books are a uniquely portable magic, said Stephen King. To weave the same around a seemingly dreary topic, we compiled a series of 7 short stories, themed around a post antibiotic era dystopia. These were written, collated and edited completely by our team members.  The preface has been written by Dr. Dipshikha Chakravortty, celebrated microbiologist, Centre for Infectious Diseases Research, IISc Bangalore. The collection is to be called ‘Resistance - Tales from a Post-Antibiotic World’ and it will be published soon by the IISc Press.In line with our commitment to ensure that our work has the maximum impact on society, we plan to make the book freely available in libraries including our own Institute's JRD Tata Memorial Library."

Imperial College,INTEGRATED HP,Summary of Integrated Human Practices,"We engaged in direct dialogue with stakeholders, as per the Communication Strategies Guide (CSG). This approach allowed us to devise potential applications for our system, as well as correct design flaws such as the use of toxic pyocyanin as a redox-cycling molecule. This led us to re-design our system with a safer molecule (phenazine methosulfate -PMS-), which we demonstrated to be a remarkably cheap and effective inducer molecule, even when compared with broadly used inducers.  We also identified that internal friction in teams is a common issue as proven to us by our experience as well as a survey that we conducted amongst 67 iGEM members from 14 other teams. To address this issue we developed our team communication app (LTAT) to help improve team communication both internally and within other teams. "
Imperial College,INTEGRATED HP,Making our technology safer," Our genetic circuit is activated/deactivated by the redox state of the transcription factor (SoxR). SoxR oxidation is modulated by  small redox molecules, such as pyocyanin. However, after Dr. Francesca Ceroni, a PI at Imperial who was pregnant at the time, declined to meet us in the lab out of concern over toxic substances, and in response to public concern that we detected over the toxicity of our system, we realized that toxicity is a huge issue with downstream implementation of our technology. Pyocyanin is a toxin synthesised by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is implicated in its virulence (Ho Sui et. al., 2012). Pyocyanin is also expensive; identifying a less expensive redox molecule could not only make our system cheaper to use, but might also provide an alternative to general inducer molecules such as IPTG due to their price. 
Through a literature search, we identified phenazine methosulfate (PMS) as a potential alternative redox molecule. 
Not only is PMS far cheaper than both pyocyanin and IPTG, it is also non-toxic and makes our system more applicable for real world applications. Using PMS, which is a small redox molecule, in concert with SoxR and pSoxS we can activate a gene much like IPTG would with plac.


Toxicity comparison between Pyocyanin and PMS
The 2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard ranks hazard ratings with the use of categories, with Category 0 being the lowest risk and Category 4 being the highest. With regards to toxicity, pyocyanin is a Category 4 substance  (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 2010) and extreme care was taken during our wet lab experiments to ensure our own safety and any contact with pyocyanin would warrant immediate medical attention. PMS on the other hand is a Category 0 substance (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 2017) and thus is far easier and safer to handle. 

Cost comparison between PMS and common inducer molecules
A cursory look at the costs of PMS, pyocyanin and common inducer molecules (such as IPTG) already reveals stark differences in costs per gram. When accounting for working concentrations, this difference is further magnified, with PMS being 407 times cheaper than IPTG and 6600 times cheaper than pyocyanin. These costs are summarized in a table below, where costs per gram are obtained using the lowest price per gram on Sigma-Aldrich. However, costs only matter if it can be shown that PMS can have a similar fold induction to common inducer molecules such as IPTG and experimental results for fold induction suggesting that this is indeed the case can be found below.

Imperial College,INTEGRATED HP,Biocontainment,"A big socio-ethical issue with using genetically engineered organisms is the issue of biocontainment. We realized the importance of this issue by talking to members of the public as well as from the socio-ethics discussion. These organisms should not be released where they could potentially cause ecological damage by outcompeting or harming native species. While some may debate the impact of this ecological damage, it would be easier to persuade governments and people to use GMOs when proper biocontainment measures are in place. Public and governmental opposition to widespread implementation of synthetic biology products will greatly affect the downstream applications of our system. This problem rings especially true as (for now) EU laws and regulations require that prior to any release of GMOs into the environment proper risk assessments and containment strategies must be in place (LOC, 2015). By controlling transcription of growth retardants or toxins, like gp2 and MazF, respectively, we can control where our bacteria will live and thus add a layer of biocontainment.

Imperial College,INTEGRATED HP,Fabric Bioprinter,"In preparation for our art exhibition, we discussed the integration of science and art with a student, Alice Potts, from the RCA. She mentioned that in fashion, chemical pollution as a result of the usage of dyes is prominent. Further reading made us aware that textile dyeing is the second largest polluter of clean water globally (Perry, 2018). We realized that using bacteria to synthesize dyes could provide for an ecologically friendly solution. Moreover, with the ability to input patterns using our electrode array, we could design simple prints. We worked on cloning the MelA gene into our construct design, but were unable to test it due to time constraints.
"
Imperial College,INTEGRATED HP,Wellbeing,"When we started our project, many of us had personal as well as interpersonal issues that threatened the viability of our project as well as our own well-being. We made it a point to reflect upon this experience and wondered if any other teams had similar issues to us. We surveyed 67 people from 13 different iGEM teams and developed a team-communication application called ""Let's Talk about It!"" as an aid for resolving these issues both for us and future iGEM teams. Most importantly, we have used the app to raise important issues with our PIs and supervisors and have these issues responded to as fast as possible. We also received feedback from a PhD candidate in psychology. Knowing that this tool exists has made us more open about our issues and help each other communicate solutions for these issues. This has raised our productivity and made us more cooperative. More information on our Team-communication application can be found here"
Jiangnan,Human Practice,OVERVIEW,
Jiangnan,Human Practice,Backgournd,"China has been suffering from serious influenza outbreak since the winter of 2017. Also, China is one of the ten countries with the highest mortality caused by pneumococcus among children under the age of five. And compared with the first type of vaccine, the vaccination rate of the second type of vaccine is still very low. However, the vaccination rate in China is only 2%, and the public lacks cognition on the importance of vaccination as well as the associated knowledge. We are thus motivated to conduct HP on disseminating vaccine related information to the public and surveying people from different social status on their view towards the practical importance of our project, with the aim of enhancing people’ cognition on vaccination and deepening our own understandings on why and how to carry out this project.

GoldTo understand the process of vaccine production, preservation and transportation, as well as vaccination, we visited some factories for vaccine production. During these visits, we found the need of establishing a cell line feasible for rapid production of a broad spectrum of vaccines, and our strategic collaboration partner, ‘Dabeinong Group’, who is willing to finance us in conducting this project. Besides, ‘Dabeinong Group’ has also supported us in offering a company tour to the vaccine production line, viruses, etc. Note that our project fully complies with iGEM’s  requirements, as we use animal viruses in this project which are non-infectious to humans. Once this project is successfully completed, not only ‘Dabeinong Group’ could significantly benefit from it by having a self-owned intellectual property cell line with reduced production cost and complexity, but also the whole vaccine industry could be greatly promoted in having a platform of establishing industrially relevant features to cells using synthetic biology approaches. To seek the practical importance of our project and external expertise to help improve it, we did the following HPs. First, we invited world leading experts from Australia to our university to guide us in our experiments and deepen our understandings on the clinical and industrial importance of this project. Second, we participated in several meet-ups with other iGEM teams. We exchanged our project ideas and discussed unresolved problems in the experiments, and received lots of pertinent suggestions on both sides. Also, we made good friends through these active communications and discussions, which constitutes the most amazing part of our memoriesTo disseminate vaccination related knowledge and the importance of our project to the public, we visited CDC (Centers for Disease Control), the community epidemic prevention station, two kindergartens and one high school. During this process, we recognized a significant lack of cognition in the public on the importance of getting vaccination in time as well as basic understandings on synthetic biology. When conducting HP on this aspect, we adopted a three-step strategy to approach, stimulate the interest and thinking of the public, i.e., discovery, practice and discussion. Through our persisting efforts, we demonstrated that it is possible to communicate with the public from all ages and diverse disciplines and social status on synthetic biology and science in general; and with our efforts, we have successfully enhanced people’ understandings on vaccination, synthetic biology as well as current social and technical challenges faced in science."
Jiangnan,Public Engagement,Overview,"Jiangnan iGEM team has stepped out of the lab to disseminate knowledge on synthetic biology, vaccination and the concept of our project to the public."
Jiangnan,Public Engagement,Open lab(July 14th),"In order to let high school students really feel the charm of biology, we held the activities called Plate Colony Painting. We invited some high school students to the public lab of our university to participate in this event. We prepared some plates and E. coli, and asked them to innovate in the plates. These students were given safety training by Yini Luo, one of our team members, before they were allowed to create imaginations with the plates and bacteria. These students indeed had full of fun, and we believed that they must had felt the charm of synthetic biology through participating in this event."
Jiangnan,Public Engagement,(August 19),"On August 19, our team and ZJU-China, ZJU-China, ASTWS-China, HFLS-ZheJiangUnited, WorldShaper-XSHS co-organized the Synthetic Biology Technology Festival at the Science and Technology Museum in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province.

Marburg,Human Practices,Accessible Science,"

    We have a moral duty to remove the barriers to participation, and to invest sufficient funding and expertise to unlock the vast potential of people with disabilities...
  


     -- Stephen Hawking
  
Although equality is a universal human right, prejudice and perceived disabilities too often exclude people with special needs from many opportunities. Especially active participation in Natural Science is much disrupted.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 253 million people worldwide live with vision impairments. 217 million have a moderate to severe visual impairment and 36 million are blind. In Germany, 1.2 million blind people lived in 2002. Of these, 600 live in Marburg and 150 of them are students of the Philipps University. Marburg has taken many steps to make the city more livable for blind people. You can find talking bus stops and elevators, shopping aids in nearly every supermarket and special rooms in the library of the Philipps University.
One of the reasons why Marburg has become this hub for blind people is the BLISTA. It is a nationwide competence center for the blind and visually impaired. It established the first high school for visually impaired students worldwide. Nowadays, this Carl-Strehl-School is the only high school in Europe preparing blind students for higher education.
Despite these ideal conditions, visually impaired students are only rarely found in fields like biology or chemistry. 
We intended to show that anyone believing blind people incapable of doing well in these fields is mistaken.
 Therefore, the crucial role in our Human Practices project fell towards public engagement and close cooperation with the BLISTA (engl.: German Institute of the Blind) to facilitate equality and accessibility in Science. In the following paragraphs, you can see for yourself.

Marburg,Human Practices,Experiment design,"
The goal of the experiment is to identify how well the wild type of V. natriegens can grow without sodium chloride if we provide consistently high sodium levels with an alternative sodium source.
Therefore, the essence of the method is a dilution series in small incremental steps.

"
Marburg,Human Practices,Medium composition and carbon source,"
"
Marburg,Human Practices,Alternative sodium sources,"

The sodium content of the media was derived from the available sodium in v2 salts.
Due to the polyvalence of the citrate and the sulfate, the overall molarity had to be adjusted. The lower solubility of sodium sulfate was taken into account and resulted in a lower stock solution  (10x NaCl = 2.4 M; 10x Na3Citrate = 0.8 M; 5x Na2SO4 = 1.2 M).
"
Marburg,Human Practices,Contents of the medium:,"
"
Marburg,Human Practices,Workflow,"
The culture inside the wells was inoculated with an overnight culture (1µL) with 100% NaCl content without alternative sodium source. 
The preliminary result of the dilution experiments is depicted below. So far sodium citrate seems to be an outstanding choice in taking up the role of NaCl as sodium source. The growth continuously stays on par with the pure NaCl culture while the growth significantly declines with increasing sodium sulfate replacement. Those results show that the NaCl content we took as none-problematic can be addressed by easily available means such as citrate salts. 

For the future experiments, adaptation of V. natriegens strains to these new sodium sources could be achieved by iterative exposure to increasing concentrations. If coupled with selection for a high growth rate, it is conceivable to reach similar doubling times to NaCl media and thereby a suitable and easy fermentation medium for the industry. "
Marburg,Education and Public Engagement, Global accessibility - A Look beyond Marburg ," The World-Wide-Web has the power to remove barriers in communication and interaction that many people with disabilities face in the physical world if programmed properly. Unbiased web design provides access to all people independent of ability or interface. At this point in time, a lot people with vision impairment still need to adjust web pages themselves to make them accessible to them.Experiencing the scientific hunger of the visually impaired during our Open Laboratory Days we questioned:
Why should the visually impaired be excluded from the amazing results iGEM teams achieve each year? As a part of our Integrated Human Practices project, we asked iGEM teams to design their wiki in ways accessible to people with disabilities. Through this, we aim to make the results of the iGEM competition accessible to everyone. For more information follow us to our Integrated Human Practices section."
Marburg,Education and Public Engagement,Hesse Day - Local Outreach in Marburg's Federal State," To reach out to all sorts of people of different social groups, we presented our iGEM project on the Hesse Day (dt.: Hessentag) in Korbach, as well as introducing basic biological principles. In the federal State of Hessen, the Hessentag is the biggest annual public festival. The ten-day lasting event took place for the 58th time and welcomed approximately 845.000 visitors this year. It unites the different parts of Hessen celebrating diversity, differences, integrations as well as tolerance. Besides a rich cultural program involving live music, arts and crafts, the Hessentag offers the space for education and knowledge transfer for everyone who is interested. "
Marburg,Education and Public Engagement,School lecture at Stiftsschule St. Johann,"Synthetic Biology is a rather young area in the field of science. Consequently, many people do not
know what it is all about and probably associate negative impressions with it. For instance, many
people are afraid of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and think that they are an evil. Often this
fear is due to little knowledge about GMOs. To uncover misunderstanding and spread the idea of
iGEM and Synthetic Biology in general, we decided to reach out to students at a local high school. In
our talk we introduced the iGEM competition, Synthetic Biology and our project and visions to the
pupils. More than 80 people from different classes participated and discussed about possibilities and
risks of Synbio afterwards. It was amazing to see the enthusiasm of the students. We, as young
scientists, also learned a lot by hearing different opinions and statements concerning Synthetic
Biology which helped us to understand public concerns about Synthetic Biology. Interestingly,
younger students had less fear of Synthetic Biology and GMOs than older students. We believe that
media plays a crucial role in the assessment of GMOs since older students had more concerns.
Fortunately, we could eliminate such fear by e.g. explaining GMOs and educating them about safety
instructions every scientist has to consider.We handed out a survey to validate the impact of our presentation and discussion on the pupils. In
this survey we asked about the understanding of and feelings towards Synthetic Biology before and
after our talk. This survey revealed that the majority of the audience neither heard of Synthetic
Biology nor iGEM but is open to get more information. This made us happy because this means that
they are generally willing to expanding their horizons. To our pleasure, we got very positive feedback
on our talk and the topics we introduced them to. Some of the students got interested in starting a
career in science and many students are now open towards GMOs and Synthetic Biology. Our goal
after organizing this event was to bypass the gap between the public and scientists and to show
them, what Synthetic Biology exactly is about and which safety aspects every scientist has to follow.
The students’ feedback revealed that we outreached these expectations and showed them that
science and Synthetic Biology is not dangerous but opens the door to a very broad field of
possibilities and applications to heal cancer, develop new drugs and understand how life is
functioning."
Marburg,Education and Public Engagement,"March for Science — Frankfurt, Germany","Social Media displayed how many of teams participated in the March of Science this year. The result is an atmosphere of belonging and support, a sense of unison that strengthens our resolve to stand in for all things that made us fall in love with science. Something that made us participate in iGEM with our projects in the first place.

We want the people to know: we are not working for profitable issues, for industries or for governments. We are young agents for our community, our continued prosperity and the betterment of our world. We fight against cancer and disease, bias, hunger, and environmental destruction.
We are here and we are loud!

Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Public’s opinion,During our project we had the occasion to talk about our research to a lot of different people (more information can be found in our Education and Public Engagement page). Those discussions were informative about the view people could have about synthetic biology and our project. Some of the main concerns can be found on Figure 1.
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Survey,"By having the idea of our project, we immediately realised that we needed a way to introduce our project to the non scientific community. Moreover, in order to integrate our project into society, we first need to know what the people want, and also, how deeply they know the subject.That’s why we first created a survey asking questions about contraception, hormonal treatments, the use of genetically engineered organisms and consequences on the environment.We wanted to have an overview of the perception of contraception and genetically engineered organisms by the general population. We developed a poll to probe as much people as we could: our survey was answered by 1163 people in both English and French.  In the poll we are asking general questions about people, their contraceptives mean, their satisfaction about it. Then we went further with question about GMOs and their perceptions, then asking their view about a contraceptive mean such as ours.The survey was mainly answered by women (Figure 2).The people that answered the poll were fairly young with an over representation of people between 18 and 25, over 50% of the poll responders (Figure 3).We also have an over representation of people with high level of education (Figure 4).And finally nearly all probed people were from France (Figure 5).Then knowing our population sample we asked their contraceptive mean (Figure 6).This was more or less representative of the general population of France, except for the so called “natural method”. We discovered that militants of this method heard about our project, and decided to make their voice heard about how they disprove it. We wanted to notify this only because they were over represented in our poll (about 20%) compared to the French population (3%) and hence could biased our poll. As a note the “natural method” is based on temperature measurements and self-assessment of the viscosity of vaginal secretions. However it seems relevant for us to mention that seems can not be seen as a contraception mean and that it is not as efficient as contraception methods. Natural methods use represent 21.8% of unplanned pregnancies cases which is the higher rate for any contraception method [12].
"
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Contraception Satisfaction,"We then asked the amount of satisfaction on their contraceptive means on a scale from 1 to 5 (giving a median of 3), the general average was of 3.74 out of 5 wish reflect a good overall satisfaction. But they were some disparities. We studied especially the most common ones: male condoms and pills. For condoms the satisfaction was of 3.34, which is quite high compared to other method. Whereas for the pill it was 2.26. Showing that the pill isn’t a very satisfactory contraception method. Furthermore 20% of the women using pills or other hormonal means have some form of medical issues or contraindication. So there is actually a place for some new non-hormonal contraceptive mean such as our project."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Impacts of Hormones,"After that we asked if they think hormones had impact on the body and our environments. 97% believed it has an impact on the body, but only 85% agreed it had an impact on the environment. We studied those other 15% and discovered they had a lower educational level than the rest of the population, suggesting their belief resulted on a lack of access to information."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,GMOs Opinion,"We also asked about general view on GMO, and 50% of people think it is dangerous for health and the environment, 18% think it is a useful process, and the rest agreed it depends on the applications and the genes implanted. By isolating data of the younger part audience (18-21) we discovered that they were more inclined to think it is a useful progress 26% (+9 points). However this showed that half of the French population still believes that modified organisms are harmful not matter their application. This was quite a surprise to us because, even though we knew are country to be historically opposed to the use of GMOs we didn’t think the proportion was still this high in 2018."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,The Project,"Finally we wanted to see the perception of our project from 1 to 5 again, and it turned out it was around 2.95, just above average which is quite reasonable as it’s a bit controversial to propose a contraceptive mean using GMOs. We concluded there is a place for a new non hormonal contraceptive mean for a part of the population but that still a majority was probably not really aware of what modified organisms were and how they could serve their health and environment in many different ways."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Conclusion,"Through our new method of contraception we encountered a lot people doubt because of the safety of the project. On the one hand, those doubts are linked to the lack of knowledge in synthetic biology and the vaginal microbiota but it is also linked to the limitations of current technologies.To answer these problems, we focused our efforts on the popularization of the subject through arts, events, and our comic strip. But we also thought about several ways to limit the contamination and dissemination of the strain to tend to a realisable project.However, our project is a possible application with vaginal microbiota in synthetic biology. We do not pretend to create a new way of contraception in the years to come. It is not a new mean of contraception close to be on the market: for now, our project consists of having spermicidal molecules produced by a bacterium. During our project, we ignored pharmaceutical aspects  (doses, side effects, safety in the organism, posology etc. )of this kind of device, this study is too new for having that kind of consideration. This kind of aspects would be take in count once we will have our bacteria well transformed and all the control devices performed.Making a contraceptive is a way to exploit the potential of the vaginal microbiota. The aim of the project is to better characterize L. Jensenii, to make it a new chassis for synthetic biology and to show the draft of a possible application of its use by opening doors to either new contraceptives or to ways to reduce infections to STIs and thus their transmission. All those reflections lead us to the different perspectives we thought about, that are present on our Perspectives page."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Interaction with professional gynecologists,"During our journey, we were able to discuss our project with a few french Gynecologists having different points of view about our project:According to them,  the scientific world knows well about probiotics, and their use is not an  innovation. What is an innovation is to use genetically engineered lactobacillus as a probiotic. It is also necessary to turn to non-hormonal contraceptives, since people tend not to want it anymore says Dr. Elisabeth Paganelli.However, the use of such bacteria raises different problematics such as potential noxious effects for the vaginal flora and the vagina. The use of the Antimicrobial Peptides coupled to Antisperm Antibodies could increase vaginal irritations and therefore rising the chances to get a Bacterial Vaginosis.In addition to that, people's vision toward GMO is quite bad (and especially in France) “That's why a product like Vagineering should get a very strong marketing and brand associated” said Paganelli.
And the fact that the product is, obviously, reversible should be made very clear from the beginning.According to Dr. Laurent Vandenbrouck, the vaginal microbiota renew itself around every 3 months, so there is a necessity to find an adequate gallenic formula.All gynecologists agreed on the fact that the world needs new contraceptives and that the scientific community should work on new alternatives to hormonal contraceptives.In conclusion, we highlighted a lack of knowledge and research around the vaginal flora. For a project such as Vagineering to really exist and be proposed, it is essential that non-scientific people better understand what is the microbiota and synthetic biology.In addition, there is a lot of concern about our project. Indeed, there is a fear of a problem of reversibility and spread of bacteria. However, the project is largely supported, showing the interest of new ways of contraception."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Popularization,"As it is probably one of the most important aspect of our project, since it directly applies to the Public life style, we decided to create different tools for the people to understand better, and make their own point of view of our project.How? By interviewing them, knowing what could be their questions. Educate them about  the vagina and its flora, contraceptives and everything about it, and synthetic biology and its possible application for women health."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,A Comic Book: Integrate our project into society,"As you saw earlier, more than 1000 people answered to our survey. The idea is that following the survey, people can give feedback and ask questions. So, we wanted a way to answer to their questions in an educative way.With the help of the artist @Minskiga, we created a popularization comic book.
This comic book has 2 main objectives:We also want our comic book to be accessible for every level of education starting from 12 years old."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,The relationship between the artist and the public,Minskiga uses her art skill to describe something that some non educated person will not obviously understand through scientific words. And she give an illustrative answer to a question. It’s actually reading a comic book instead of reading a scientific paper.We created characters for the public to identify themselves in the story.
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Answering questions from the survey and social networks feedback through the comic book,"Through social networks and our survey, people asked us a lot of questions about our project. We used those questions to build a storyline and answer to most of them."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Bibliography,"For each and every pages of the comic book, we had to search and confirm informations in scientific papers. As we will provide knowledge to non educated people, we need to have sources for everything we said.However, our comic book is made for the people to start a reflexion about contraception and synthetic biology. The knowledge we give is therefore not exhaustive."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,What’s next?,"We want to edit and publish this comic book. Indeed, Minskiga did, and is still doing a very hard work on the project, and we are proud of it. So, after the presentation at the Giant Jamboree, we will try to print the comic and license it."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Biosafety,"Working  within the thematic of contraception  raises many questions: sterilization, contamination, pollution... We will discuss these points below."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Antibodies Risk,"Among our spermicidal molecules, we used the antibody YLP20 and the antingen YLP12 that can cause infertility in women and men. That is a question that we had through our project : can you create a virus? Maybe the use of YLP12 can trigger a sterilization of the user? It must be known that the YLP12 antigen is already present in the human body. To be fertile, there must be an autoimmune response. As we have summarized, YLP12 has no immunogenic power.The creation of a contraception vaccine (CV) is a reflection that has been taking place for quite some time. For example, animals [1] and human [2] studies have shown that deliberate immunization of males and females with sperm causes contraception effect.  So, with recent advances in the fields of vaccinology, adjuvants, and nanotechnology it should be possible to realise a CV [3].However, if we can create a CV, we can create a virus. The limit is very fine between virus and vaccine. Indeed, a vaccine must not itself cause illness or death, it should be protective and gives sustained protection. It induces neutralizing antibody and protective T cells.In conclusion, there is no risk at our level to create an immune reaction and thus no risk of sterilizing the people because of this antigen."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Dissemination,Working with organisms aimed at vaginal flora implies a very thorough reflection on the spread.  The people we interacted with showed a lot of reluctance to our project because of the following points concerning dissemination:That’s why we thought at several biocontainment strategies according to prevent unintended proliferation of GMOs in natural ecosystems  to chronological time.
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Physical containment,"If we would like our product to be distributed in a few years, one of the best answer is probably to use a physical containment. The membrane’s nanoporosity allows spermicidal molecules produced by L.jensenii to pass through the membrane, but the bacteria remains confined.For that, we can use biocompatible polymers. A possible biocompatible polymer could be bacterial celluloser.We could imagine a design of cellulose Whatman like filter maintaining our modified L. jensenii inside the container and spermicidal molecules to be able to pass through the filter (Figure 7).During one of our meeting with the iGEM Toulouse team (you can check our Collaborations page), we discussed about the dissemination of modified L. jensenii in our system.
As their bacteria can produce cellulose, we thought we could build a containment system made of bacterial cellulose in order to confine the cells.However, this system would probably make the interval of intake shorter due to the probable death of the confined bacteria. What is positive is that system is fast, effective, reversible and avoid interaction between our bacteria and the commensal microbiota. However, such a system is similar to Intrauterine devices  as it is still invasive. In addition,  and we do not stop horizontal transfers."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Kill switch,"Toxin antixin avoiding mutationDeadman circuit uses a small molecule binding transcription factor to produce a “survival” state in which repression of toxin production is linked to the presence of a specific environmental signal.
Upon loss of the environmental signal, the circuit switches to the “death” state in which de-repressed toxin production kills the cell [4].Temperature kill-switch: avoid disseminationCyodeath utilize a toxin–antitoxin system in which toxin CcdB is expressed if optimal temperatures are not met. If the memory element is lost and the transcription factor is absent, the essentializer system induces production of CcdB and the cell dies [5]. Thus, our engineered Lactobacillus jensenii would live inside the body (37°C) and, outside of the body, the bacteria would die.

Organisms engineered for synthetic auxotrophiesImagine that you drink your coffee each morning and this permit your contraception to work properly! And when you stop, your dependant-caffeine bacteria die. This kind of kill-switch could be a good way to sustain survival or trigger destruction of engineered cells using molecules not present in the body and widely used by humans!The C-STAR system developed by Bojar et al. can [6] induce gene expression with caffeine by enabling engineered mammalian cells to directly sense caffeine at physiologically relevant concentrations. Thereby, it’s making possible to fine-tune therapeutic transgene expression in response to routine intake of beverages, such as tea and coffee without supplementation of any additional chemicals!  In this paper, cells are modified and it express expression pathway different that we want. We are thinking about this system for our bacteria.  Indeed, a system exists in E.coli that react to caffeine. This is the case of a caffeine sensor, developed by our advisor Hung-Ju Chang in Montpellier [7].A similar strategy is to design organisms with an altered chemical language that isolates them from natural ecosystems. The idea is to redesign essential enzymes in an organism possessing an altered genetic code to confer metabolic dependence on non-standard amino acids for survival.  Mandell et al. assigned the UAG stop codon to incorporate a non-standard amino acid (NSAA) and computationally redesigned the cores of essential enzymes to require the NSAA for proper translation [8]. Thanks to that, they show that organisms exhibit unprecedented resistance to evolutionary escape through mutagenesis and horizontal gene transfers!Moreover, the bacteria can have a synthetic amino acid [9] or a synthetic nucleotid and their absence is lethal."
Montpellier,Integrated human practices,Switch-off,"At the end, the best solution is to keep L.jensenii in our microbiota all the time and make it produce or not the spermicidal molecule! Challenges remain before these engineered bacteria can meet the market. For that, we met different problematics. We need a better understanding of how the bacteria interact with the body and other organisms.Switch-offFirst of all the concept of turning ON/OFF a gene is well studied. Many mechanisms allow the extinction of a gene. However, we must add a ""memory"" in the DNA of bacteria to maintain the repression.HiFi GenomeA genome is bound to undergo changes trough single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other environmental modifications. The thing is, in our project, the action of epigenetics and SNPs aren’t welcome. That’s why we need to maintain the genome integrity. We need to take care of editing the bacterium's chromosome, rather than its plasmids because is it too “mobile”. We need to limit the bacteria ability to share DNA with other bacteria which would create long-term safety risks [10].
Gallagher et al. [11] employed safeguards based on auxotrophy, independent essential gene riboregulation, repressor supplementation, and engineered addiction to eliminate persistence and limit escape frequencies.  This work describes the implementation and advantages of multilayered genetic safeguards in E. coli, so we can imagine a same system in L. jensenii.Moreover, the bacteria can have an amino acid synthetic [9] or a synthetic nucleotide to create a synthetic organism that can not interact with the other bacteria from the microbiota. So, it is a possibility to create synthetic nucleic acids."
Montpellier,Education & Public Engagement,Events,"During our project we participated in different events with the goal of popularizing synthetic biology and presenting our project to the public. In this section, we elaborate on the different events and how we used them to promote learning and engagement in the community."
Montpellier,Education & Public Engagement,Presentation to our scientific peers: Feedback from the community,"Before and after the bulk of our wet lab research during the summer, we presented our project to our colleagues at our host institution, the Centre de Biochimie Structurale (Center for Structural Biology) in Montpellier, for feedback.  Additionally, we presented at the end of the summer to the DGIMI lab (Diversity Genomes & Insect Microorganisms Interactions, INRA) to further refine our scientific presentation skills and to obtain additional feedback from scientists in a broad range of sub-disciplines."
Montpellier,Education & Public Engagement,Fête de la Science,"On October 5th and 6th, we participated in the ‘Fête de la science’ at the Faculty of Education at the University of Montpellier,  a large, annual nationwide event to promote interaction between the public and the scientific community. There, we taught 10-15 year old students and their parents about DNA, bacteria, and genetically modified organisms.We brought several teaching aids with us, including a model of a DNA double helix, posters explaining synthetic biology (Figure 1), and a small game where the children would need to arrange promoters, ribosome binding sites, genes, and terminators to construct a complete ‘sentence’.Additionally, to spark visual interest and foster interaction, we brought several Petri dishes with bacteria. Some were without antibiotics and contained swabs from different parts of the body to visually illustrate the microbiome; others contained works of bacteriART (Figure 2), drawings using E. coli expressing either mKate2 or super-folder GFP to draw in passersby with their bright colors. While we enjoyed explaining our project and synthetic biology to the community (Figure 3), we were incredibly impressed the number of thoughtful questions we received and the depth of curiosity people showed about synthetic biology. Even the parents were interested in learning more about our Vagineering project!"
Montpellier,Education & Public Engagement,Organizing High School-Level Lecture and Lab Practical,"In collaboration with the iGEM team from the Sorbonne University, we also organized and participated in two lectures for a high school class, with a corresponding lab practical. In the first class, we presented an overview lecture about DNA and mutations with a hands-on practical lab component (Figure 4).  During the lecture, we explained how DNA is copied and transferred between generations and how subsequent interference can lead to mutations. This was coupled with experiments where yeast were exposed to UV rays for different durations. This showed them the changing of color of some colonies (we used Ade2 mutant that were originally red and got back to a white color) and the difference of number of colonies  During the second class the following week, we analyzed the results of the experiment with the students, followed by an introductory lecture on synthetic biology and our iGEM project. We hope to have kindled some interest in their young minds to join  the next generation of iGEMers."
Montpellier,Education & Public Engagement,"Synthetic Biology Workshop, a feedback from students","On October 10th, we presented a lecture on the principles of synthetic biology our Vagineering project to two classes of master’s degree students: one studying Health Biology/Bioproduction and the other Host Microorganism interactions (Figure 5).Over 90 minutes, we covered an overview of synthetic biology, techniques used in both wet lab and modeling, and an account of our Vagineering project and the iGEM competition in general.As many of these students could be future iGEMers as early as next year, we sought to spark their interest in not only the opportunity to conceive of and pursue a research project but also our efforts to popularize our project and interact with the community at large."
Montpellier,Education & Public Engagement,Press Coverage,"Smile, you're on camera!  The promotion of our iGEM project is important for fostering awareness of our project. As the first iGEM team to come from Montpellier, we were fortunate to be interviewed by several publications of the print and news media.June 6, 2018: EUSynbioBeta

Montpellier,Education & Public Engagement,Art,"As our project concerns an important aspect of society that, nevertheless, is considered taboo in certain cultures and communities, we wanted to use the humanizing power of several artistic endeavors to further cultivate a collective conversation about our project. We deliberately sought out non-scientific artists in the community to help us with so that they might provide a unique perspective to help us bridge the gap between ourselves and members of the community.  The aim of this work is to educate members of the community to the existence of the vaginal microbiota/flora and the vulva through visual media with non-scientific artists."
Montpellier,Education & Public Engagement,Social media,"Artists from different backgrounds produced artwork about their ‘vision of the vulva’, the vagina, and their microbiota.We gave prompts to the artists and let them express their creativity starting from that.
For exemple, to the question: What is your vision of a vaginal flora?
Barzoii “artistic” answer : It’s a forest inside a vulva.The artistic visuals produced by the artists will be the bridge between the public and the scientific knowledge.Here are some examples."

Montpellier,Education & Public Engagement,Comic Book: Synthetic Biology & the Vaginal Microbiota,"With the help of the artist Minskiga (@Minskiga on Instagram), we created a comic book with two objectives in mind:Minskiga is an art school student without any formal education in biology, and therefore will have her own reactions to and perception of scientific ideas, which is precisely the perspective we were looking for. She uses her art skills to describe something that is difficult to do to people unversed in scientific vocabulary.For example, we worked with Minskiga to provide a definition of synthetic biology (Figure 10).This page is the result of fruitful discussions with the artist, with the aim of entertaining the public and educating them in the fundamentals of synthetic biology.Additionally, through social networks and our survey, we received many questions from an interested public and this comic book provided an outlet to answer those questions in the form of a vibrant storyline.This comic book is the result of more than three months of work, but will soon be finished and disseminated into the community. You can find out much more about the comic book in our Integrated Human Practices page!"
Nanjing-China,Human_Practices,Overview,"Our  project lays emphasis on a vital aspect of energy utilization, thus it is  crucial that we have thought carefully and creatively about the impact of our  work and acquired the guidance of the design and experimental methods in our  project from the interaction with stakeholders and experts.Firstly, we designed special brochures  to enlarge our team.The next section, Background, is  about the development of nitrogenous fertilizer production in China as well as  the fact that free nitrogen, though substantial in the air, needs to overcome  considerable obstacle to react with other substances at normal temperature.  These have motivated us to further explore the actual effect of fertilizer.By meeting with  stakeholders and experts, we were able to initiate the original idea of utilizing  solar energy to fix nitrogen, modify the experimental methods and reform our  design of device to be more relevant and responsible. The section of Integrated  Human Practices alsodemonstrateshow our project advanced as  the interactions with stakeholders and experts went on over time."
Nanjing-China,Human_Practices,Brochure,"
Initially, to spread iGEM and get  more students on board with us, we printed and sent out brochures designed by  our team, which ultimately attracted students from different majors, equipping  our team with various talents. You can click here to  download the PDF file of our brochure. "
Nanjing-China,Human_Practices,Background,"Nitrogenous  fertilizer production has been playing a pivotal role since the 20th  century. Yet, the fact is that the average soil nitrogenous fertilizer storage  all around the world is rather small. What’s more, the accumulation of nitrogen  in the soil is a tough process, and modern intensive agriculture leads to the  excessive loss of organic matter and nitrogen in the soil. Under most conditions,  the production of nitrogen in yield per unit is higher than that of phosphorus  and potassium nutrients.In  the past decades, the industry of nitrogenous fertilizer in China has made  remarkable achievements through unremitting efforts, with capacity for  indigenous innovation constantly increasing. By 2017, China has become the largest  producer and consumer of nitrogenous fertilizer, greatly contributing to the  development of fertilizer industry and agriculture around the world.With  the implementation of China's ""five-in-one"" policy, a large number of  contaminating factories have been shut down. We noted that Yantai Wuzhou Feng  Fertilizer Plant is located in the water conservation area of  Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Province, and its traditional method of producing nitrogenous  fertilizer consumes massive energy, meanwhile, causing large quantities of  pollution, which severely affects water and soil resource in the environment."
Nanjing-China,Human_Practices,Xiaohe Bei Village ,"We  visited farmers in Xiaohe Bei Village, Ju County, Rizhao City, Shandong  Province, so that we could communicate with the users, direct stakeholders, of nitrogenous  fertilizer.During the  conversation with them, we were informed that the nitrogenous fertilizer sold  on the market is of high cost, and the quality of it couldn’t be guaranteed.  Farmers are in urgent need of fertilizer products with guaranteed quality and  affordable prices.Based on our previous work (Nanjing-China 2016) on  photosynthetic hydrogen production, we wondered whether we could utilize solar  energy to fix nitrogen, which is an environmentally-friendly and economical  method for production. "
Nanjing-China,Human_Practices,Yantai Wuzhou Feng Fertilizer Plant,"With  the idea of photosynthetic nitrogen fixation, we contacted Yantai Wuzhou  Feng Fertilizer Plant. During  the course of the exchange, the manager of Yantai Wuzhou Fertilizer Plant, Mr  Li, told us the technical bottlenecks encountered so far. The main production  of nitrogenous fertilizer, urea, was still following traditional methods, with  liquid ammonia and carbon dioxide as raw materials and then urea directly  synthesized under conditions of high temperature and pressure. After fully understanding the current production and demand of nitrogenous fertilizer, we introduced our project to them, and proposed applying synthetic biology to realize photosynthetic nitrogen fixation, which would not only cut down cost but also effectively reduce environmental pollution. They expressed great interest in the application of synthetic biology for nitrogen fixation and the use of solar energy, a clean energy source for production. Yet,  they raised some problems that might arise in the production process as well,  such as the contamination of cadmium sulfide, semiconductor materials attached  to the surface of Escherichia coli, whether cadmium sulfide would affect  the physiological activity of Escherichia coli or not, how to convert  nitrogen fixation inside engineered bacteria into mass production of nitrogenous  fertilizer and so on. We carefully collected these problems above. "
Nanjing-China,Human_Practices,Improvement of our project,"When  we came back, we seriously considered these practical problems in experimental  design and continuously improved experimental method.Firstly,  toxicity test was conducted to determine the maximum amount of Cd2+  that is agreeable for E. coli growth.For  further information about this experiment, please check it out on our protocol and result page. Moreover,  in order to apply our nitrogen fixation system to practical use, maybe into  mass production in the future, we also came up with an idea of designing a device  for the growth of engineered strain. Our integrated human practices  strategy helped us to look at how we could make our device as user-friendly as  possible. "
Nanjing-China,Human_Practices,Interactions with microbial researchers,"At  the beginning, we designed a device consisting of 3 modules: incubation,  illumination, control, which is suitable for engineered strain to grow and  participate in reaction under adjustable light conditions.Our  interactions with microbial researchers shaped our final design and made it  possible for practical application. When xenon modulator tube is illuminating,  it would heat the air inside incubator, thus making the environment unfavorable  for our engineered strain.
To  solve this problem, we were advised to place a reflux condenser to cool the  xenon modulator tube, keeping the most suitable temperature."
NAU-CHINA,Integrated HP,Developing Project ,"Based on Google Trends and our interests, we chose medical care, the hottest issue of recent society, as the field of our research, and cancer attracted our attention as the most concerned area in medical field. It is estimated that in 2014, the number of new cases of malignant tumors in China was 3.804 million (2.11 million males and 1.69 million females), and an average of seven people per minute was diagnosed with cancer (data from the National Cancer Center). According to the latest data released by the American Cancer Society in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, there will be 1,688,780 new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths in the United States in 2017. Cancer is a global disease that threatens human health, and is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Statistics show that there were 1,688,780 new cases in the United States in 2017, which means that 4,600 new cancer patients were added every day[1].CAR-T (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell Immunotherapy) is a kind of immunotherapy that embedded an antigen receptor on T cell. An antigen receptor combines antibodies against specific tumor antigens with CD3ζ, FcεRIγ in T cells and expresses them on patient T cells in vitro. The engineered T cells are amplified, screened, and returned to the patient in large quantities. The basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to clear cancer cells, which is called a cell therapy rather than a drug one. CARs consist of intracellular signaling regions (for example, CD3ζ and CD28), transmembrane regions, and extracellular antigen-binding regions of the T cell receptor (TCR). Recombinant CARs rely on the antigen but not on the presentation of MHC, effectively avoiding the immune escape mechanism of MHC down-regulation Cytokine storm refers to a variety of cytokines in body fluids such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, and MCP. The rapid and massive occurrence of -1 and IL-8 is an important cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. It is a side effect of CAR-T immunotherapy. In order to relieve cytokine storm, we developed a kind of engineered T cell, which can monitor and relieve cytokine storm automatically[2]."
NAU-CHINA,Integrated HP, Improving Project,"In order to solve the experimental problems coming out with the progress of our research projects, we came to Shanghai Institute of Biological Sciences (SIBS), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to conduct some interviews. This also plays an important role in education & public engagement.We got ourselves well prepared for the interviews. First, we browsed the website of the SIBS to determine the list of researchers to be interviewed. Considering the theme of the project, we selected several researchers who have made great achievements in the field of cancer treatment. Prof. Wang Hongyan    new mechanisms of inflammation regulated by immunocytes and inflammation-related diseases Prof. Meng Feilong   ways to suppress the occurrence of immune system tumors and important factors in various immunodeficiency diseases Prof. Yang Chenghua    malignancy molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis and development, and the development and mechanism of targeted therapy for small molecule drugs Prof. Ji Hongbin   molecular mechanism of lung cancer Prof. Chen Jianfeng  functional regulation of cell adhesion molecules in inflammation and cancerIn mid-July, 2018, we explained our interview intentions by email to these researchers, and appointed the interview time with them.Secondly, we thoroughly reviewed the relevant works and scientific research results of these researchers, prepared the interviews in a targeted manner, and intended to ask them questions about their research directions. In doing so, we can not only understand the complete and authoritative information but also get closer to the respondents.During the interview, we asked the respondents in detail about questions of cancer, cancer treatment, new therapies, immunotherapy, and the rationality of the pricing of cancer treatments in the current market. The researchers offered detailed answers. We have changed application field of our project from weakening cytokine storm to monitoring EFGR targeted cancer by following recommendations from the principal investigators in SIBS. The reason why we change the application field is that Synnotch cannot be used in the solution environment. Therefore, we change the target from different kinds of cytokines to EGFR, a kind of protein on the surface of the cell membrane, which can be bound with synthetic extracellular recognition domain of Synnotch effectively.EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is a protein that exists on the surface of both normal cells and cancer cells. EGFR is very important for cell growth and differentiation. When a cell's ligand binds to EGFR, EGFR will be activated, which will send a signal to the inside of the cell to control cell growth through the cell pathway.However, compared with normal cells, many cancer cells have mutations that overexpress EGFR. When the ligand is attached to the mutated EGFR, this signal will remain “sent” all the time, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and response. Different EGFR mutations lead to different kinds of cancers, for example, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.If we replace the upstream extracellular domain of our subject with EGFR antibodies, our design can accurately identify EGFR with different densities on the cell membrane surface, and judge whether the cells change according to the density of EGFR, thus realizing the recognition of cancer cells. Moreover, we can adjust the immune strength of the engineered immune cells and the threshold value of EGFR recognition by adjusting the promoter strength and the type of recombinase, so as to accurately distinguish normal cells with low density EGFR from cancerous cells with high density EGFR, protect normal cells to the maximum extent, and recognize and kill cancerous cells. More project application details are shown in application."
NAU-CHINA,Integrated HP, Application Research: Bigger Picture,"As the work progresses, we recognize that our system can convert the external fluctuation signals into simple 0 and 1 signals to realize the function of the analog-to-digital converter. Our system is very suitable for information processing. If we can convert the expression signals into electrical signals through light sensing elements in the future, we can realize the image displayed on our LOGO ——converting biological information into electronic information, making the machine biological and making biology engineering.We have broadened our thinking, and the application of the topic is far more than the therapeutic field.By replacing the identification object of the upstream system, the measurement of a certain substance can be realized. By adjusting the types of downstream promoters and recombinases, the system threshold can be adjusted. Then the system can not only detect the presence or absence of substances but also dynamically detect the concentration of the detected substances.  In the process of industrial production and environmental monitoring, by modifying the upstream channel, cells can identify their own products, metabolic wastes or miscellaneous bacteria, etc., and realize automatic adjustment of production according to external conditions or remind people to deal with corresponding situations.We met with relevant practitioners in the above fields and showed them our project. We came to the Department of Oncology of the Third People's Hospital of Luoyang City, Henan Province, China, and conducted a simple interview with Dr. GuoJianfeng, director of the Oncology Department. Dr. Guo first was briefed on our iGEM project, and then he answered several questions about EGFR (record of this interview see attachments). We also interviewed several practitioners working in environmental protection fields. They also gave us a detailed explanation of the current problem-solving solutions in the related fields. In the future, we can replace T cells with any kind of cells, engineer them, and solve a series of social problems."

NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement, Origin of Our Work,"With the progress of the project in the laboratory, we have also learned that the public do not have sufficient knowledge of cancer, cancer treatment and new cancer therapy. Therefore, we believe that we should go into the society to cover the blind spots in the public's knowledge, and eliminate their misunderstanding of science and technology rather than limit the project in the laboratory."
NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement, Society Cognition,"We investigated the public in the streets to understand the public's awareness of scientific knowledge. The interviews took place in three places, Xinjiekou Commercial District, called China's first business district, Nanjing South Railway Station, the largest railway station in Asia, and Xiamafang Heritage Park, a century-old scenic spot. These three locations have great traffic and a complete demographic structure.Public cancer knowledge has been known through interview and questionnaire survey. We found out some points as follows:1. People have a low level of scientific knowledge about cancer, and almost no knowledge of new cancer therapies.2. As people grow older, their knowledge of cancer will grow. One reason for this is that there are more and more cancer patients around them.3. Middle-aged and elderly people pay attention to health knowledge. They perform better than young people in keeping health, and they have a more correct concept of health.General public lacks scientific knowledge, and has long been misled by pseudoscience. This is a common phenomenon in today's society.(Detailed results of questionnaire see in this PDF document.) "
NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement, Access to Knowledge,"In order to gain authoritative scientific knowledge about cancer, which will be used for publicity, we interviewed several researchers who have made great achievements in the field of cancer treatment working in SIBS. They gave us authoritative knowledge about cancer and latest cancer treatment. Their words made us feel the social responsibility on the shoulders.“Treating a disease is not an individual's behavior. It requires the engagement of the government. The development of the entire social welfare system depends on whether a person can receive extra help in different stages of his/her life.” By Prof. Wang Hongyan “Intellectual property rights should not be greater than human rights, and money should not be more important than human life. The government is suggested to assume this responsibility with medical insurance or other forms.” By Prof. Ji Hongbin “At present, many pharmaceutical companies in China are also growing, and they will have such capabilities in a few years.” By Prof. Yang Chenghua“Scientific research is not so easy.”  By Prof. MengFeilong(More details of interview see in the PDF document.) "
NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement,Science Popularization Campaign,"With the authoritative scientific knowledge about cancer, we started publicity and education for the public. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, a very famous historic site with the huge traffic, is the place where we launched our campaign. From June to September, we have organized a total of six events with huge social impact.We promote science popularization through forms like exhibition boards and brochures. The content covers cancer common sense (such as cancer causes, cancer treatment methods, etc.), synthetic biology introduction and the project of our team. Our activities took various forms, including introduction and games about scientific knowledge. "
NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement, Larger Influence & Further Vision,"Nanjing Daily, a local newspaper with many readers, reported our work on popularizing scientific knowledge to the general public. Broad social responses were spurred by this report, and our work has been recognized and appreciated by the public. We also promoted scientific knowledge through WeChat official account, a popular online social media in China. The online popularization has attracted readers numbered in hundreds and has contributed to a wide range of social impacts.In the future, we want to expand our activity to the whole society, eliminate pseudoscience and spread authoritative scientific knowledge to the general public. In order to achieve this, we must cooperate with government. We have got connect with some relevant government officers and further work is being negotiated."
NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement, Middle School: Enlightenment,"Synthetic biology, as a new branch of biology, is very useful and powerful. It’s a pity that, however, it is not well-known. Middle school students, with creativity and knowledge, are who we want to enlighten with knowledge of synthetic biology. We want to inspire them to create with synthetic biology to benefit society.From October 2017 to October 2018, we held joint synthetic biology science training camp with Jinling Middle School by monthly lecture. We brought them synthetic biology and its latest application. As the activity progressed, the students' understanding of synthetic biology deepened and the enthusiasm for learning increased. In the last few lessons, they gave us a description of synthetic biology and the highest ideals of synthetic biology in their minds. We are deeply impressed by their creativity. After the event, we exchanged ideas with the school officers. The school officers expressed their willingness to build an iGEM team affiliated to Jinling Middle School. They hoped to get our help and support. We also expressed our willingness to work with them to build a team which is full of passion for synthetic biology and creativity."
NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement, College: Professional,"Compared with our education activity in middle school, our education activity in college is more professional and more targeted. We held lectures about synthetic biology and organized a competition called “agar art”, which allows competitors using microorganisms to create artworks on agar medium. We also allowed students to get into our lab and see what we do every day. We successfully spread synthetic biological knowledge and philosophy, and involve a group of students to get into it."
NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement,iGEMcloud: Create A Platform,"We developed iGEMCloud to solve some current problems of iGEM, with its immediacy, openness and interactivity.Fast and accurate event information of iGEM are provided in iGEMCloud. It allows everyone to post messages in the corresponding section for others to view or reply, and the writer will receive notices. Based on this, a rich social possibility of iGEM is built. We provide searching, collection, attention, and other features that could make it easier for users to interact. iGEMers from different teams in different countries can openly discuss issues together. We provide team space for each team, where team members can publish the news of the team for others viewing and interacting. In this way, barriers of cooperation between teams could be removed..This application will serve as a community for iGEMers. It can also expand the influence of iGEM events. Here, researchers can gather and exchange ideas.The application could be one of the most iGEM style communities."
NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement, Nanjing iGEM Seminar,"At the end of May, we participated in an exchange meeting hosted by Nanjing University. The meeting was attended by Zhang Haoqian as a keynote speaker, and representatives from Nanjing University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing Foreign Languages School, and Nanjing Agricultural University participated. We reported our project to those universities and middle school and gained some suggestions came from Mr. Zhang and other schools. We started cooperate with China Pharmaceutical University in this seminar."

There are about 20 teams from China, Taiwan and Japan took part in this magnificent conference. During this five days' meeting, all teams present their projects by PowerPoint slides and show us their posters. We are deeply impressed by several novel, innovate projects of some teams, and launched several collaborations with them. We also did our best to present our project to judge, professor Que, and received many sharp but beneficial guidance opinions. Besides projects presentation and collaborations with other teams, hanging out and having fun are also important part of this conference. We had a pleasure night with iGEM Fudan, iGEM XMU-China, NCHU-Formosa and other teams, we shared funny stories and difficulties we faced during the presentation."
NAU-CHINA,Public Engagement, CCiC,"We attended the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) held by ShanghaiTech University from August 28 to August 30. More than 50 teams from Chinese universities and high schools participated in the meeting. During the meeting, each team displayed its project through PPT, posters and other means, looking for problems and perfecting the project with the help of judges and other teams.  We also gained many valuable suggestions from judges and other teams in the process of displaying our project. For example, the judges put forward some requirements for us in terms of digital models and other teams also put forward some questions about our digital models.In addition to sharing and exchanging projects, listening to the master's report and the experience sharing meeting of IGEM's predecessors also benefited us a lot. Through the master's report, we learned about the current situation and future development direction of synthetic biology. The experience of IGEM predecessors such as Haoqian Zhang in participating in the competition is of great significance for us to participate in the competition in Boston."
NAU-CHINA,HUMAN HEALTH, Sliver,"To establish an element with the function of analog-to-digital converter, our project can be used not only in EGFR targeted cancer monitoring and treatment, but also in other disease treatment, environmental pollution monitoring, and any other occasions which involve monitoring and “ all or nothing” corresponding.We thought carefully about what we can do to serve the world when we established our project. Based on plenty of research on the hottest issues, Human practice group of our team locked CAR-T, a kind of cancer immunotherapy. We intend to focus on Cytokine storm, a side effect of CAR-T, and build a project which is dedicated to weakening its effect.  Next, we conducted interviews scientifically. We brought our idea and our project to principal investigators in Chinese Academy of Sciences, medical researchers and doctors. Taking their suggestions, we corrected and improved our project, changing the application field of our project from weakening cytokine storm to monitoring EFGR targeted cancer. It makes our project more scientific and practical.Through human practice, we learned about CAR-T, the latest cancer immunotherapy, and learned in detail about its ins and outs, including its side effects, cytokine storms. We also learned more about EGFR, how it links cancer, and cancer treatments that target it. We also learned about society's perception of cancer and how to conduct investigations scientifically to understand society. "
NAU-CHINA,HUMAN HEALTH, Gold,"We integrated our human practice into our project.First, our project began with human practice. Human practice team brought CAR-T to our team, and we designed our project in order to weaken cytokine storm.  Second, our project was revised by human practice. We have changed the application prospect of our project from weakening cytokine storm to monitoring EFGR targeted cancer, by following recommendations from interviewing principal investigators in Chinese Academy of Sciences. The reason why we changed it is that Synnotch cannot be used in the solution environment. EGFR, a kind of protein on the surface of the cell membrane, can be bound with synthetic extracellular recognition domain of Synnotch effectively.Third, we brought our project to practitioners in the related fields. We demonstrated how our project can be used in these fields and received feedbacks.(More related works have been shown in integrated human practice.) "

NEFU China,GOLD INTEGRATED,Suggestion From Professor,"

            1. We discussed with Professor Yuhua Li, when we wanted to choose a chemical agent to induce the expression of Bax (BCL2 Associated X, Apoptosis Regulator) gene, Professor Li suggested that we could use the α-factor to induce the pFig2c promoter to initiate the expression of Bax suicide gene. In this case, α-type yeast can naturally produce α-factor, which can be recognized by a-type yeast to induce the pFig2c promoter.
            2. When we discussed these questions with Professor Chunbo Teng, she suggested that we can use introns that can be spliced out during mRNA maturation to further encrypt our information.
            "
NEFU China,GOLD INTEGRATED,Opinion,"

            Because we have taken into account the interception of information during message transmission, spy yeast ( the information carrying yeast, designated as ""spy yeast"", a-type yeast) can be induced to trigger apoptosis by the α factor of the killer yeast (α-type yeast) in the process of complete cultivation. The limited culturing time of the yeast prior to their death can prevent information from being leaked out. When designated receiver gets the information-carrying yeast and culture it properly, the yeast can successfully survive. 

            
"
NEFU China,GOLD INTEGRATED,Applications,"

            Through communication with experts from the National Secrecy Bureau of Heilongjiang Province in China, we learned that if our system can be used in the encryption industry, we should be as rigorous as possible in our biological principles. We must limit the equipment and personnel access scopes to ensure that the entire encryption process is rigorous enough. For example, the transport of information-carrying yeast powder and the storage of the keys should be the responsibility of different people, and each part should be accessible to a limited number of people.

			As a student who is not major in biology, synthetic biology is so far for me, but this mini-game opens the door to a new world for me. I never thought that biological knowledge could be applied in information storage and encryptions, this mini-game really helped me learn a lot.
            
			I found that if I were a burglar who wanted to get true information without correct primers, I had to go through a lot of trials, which shows that this encryption system has stronger confidentiality than the existing encryption methods.
            
			This game is very interesting, and the biological knowledge involved is also refreshing, but I think that if we finally get the sentence that there is blank instead of a string of letters, it may be more convenient for the recipient.
			Through the player's self-report, we know that our small game really allows players to learn the biological knowledge of our project, and experience the difficulties of cracking our system. At the same time, their suggestions also let us know the shortcomings of our case. We will use computer programming to improve our password book to achieve the effect of word segmentation.

            Our project is about the storage, encryption and transportation of information, so we decided to interview relevant experts and potential users for their advice to optimize our project.


National Institutions
The National Secrecy Bureau of Heilongjiang Province in China

First of all, we explained the principles and innovations of our case to the experts, and put forward an issue: how can we avoid violent cracking?
Experts’ advice:

			1. Violent cracking is unavoidable, so worry is unnecessary.
			2. Do physical isolation to avoid any possible actions that may divulge secret information in the encryption process.
			3. Rights Management. We can authorize the staffs in an organization with different levels of access permissions.
			4. Maintain an excellent routine record. We need to record the times and purposes of all usage.
			Through the communication with experts, we know that if our system is really going to be used in this field, we not only need to be as rigorous as possible in our biological principles, but also need to limit the equipment and personnel settings to ensure the whole process is rigorous enough.

NEU China A,Human Practices, Human Practice ,"This is NEU_China's third trip to iGEM, and the members of team A are mostly major in biomedical. We are quite concerned about the advances in biotechnology and the cutting-edge research that can make a difference in the medical field. So we want to try a new track, Therapeutics.
Once in a group discussion, a team member shared that her sister's experience with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and we became interested in it. After reading some academic literature, we found that the incidence of IBD is related to the destruction of intestinal bacterial strings, and the incidence of this disease in China is increasing. Therefore, we chose the treatment of IBD as the topic of our project. In addition, we refer to past projects and hope to control the disease by a release of immunosuppressants by engineering bacteria.

			The literature shows that IBD is frequent in young, so we want to investigate young people's understanding of gut health and IBD. We produced relevant questionnaires and posted them on a social website, and ended up with 291 responses. 
			After the survey data came out, we immediately analyzed and discussed with our instructor, professor Ding Chen. Here are some important conclusions:
i.	Young people know less about bowel disease and IBD
Only a few people pay attention to information related to intestinal diseases, and most people only pay attention to information related to problems or other special situations. Awareness of intestinal diseases and IBD is low in some developed regions.

			ii.	Young people have a concentrated source of information about disease
When we surveyed participants for information on bowel disease or health, we found that the vast majority of their information came from the Internet.
			iii.	Young people lack intestinal health awareness
			When asked if they would take care of their gut health in their daily lives, nearly 80 percent of the participants said they would not take care of their gut health. This contrasts sharply with the rapidly rising incidence of the disease.
			iv.	Intestinal diseases affect people's normal lives
For participants who have been identified with bowel diseases, we asked questions about the impact of bowel disease on their lives, most of whom believed that it affected their lives.  Some even thought that some bowel diseases significantly reduced their quality of life.
			v.	In the treatment plan, people care most about efficacy
In this questionnaire, we asked participants what factors they were most concerned about in the treatment regimen. Participants were asked to rank the effects, costs, side effects, risks, and access approaches, and most of them rated efficacy as most important, followed by cost, side effects, risks, and ease of access. This inspires us, when designing treatment, in order to satisfy people's expectation to cure, work hard on curative effect more.
			vi.	Most people do not know about bacterial therapy
Finally, we asked the participants to talk about their acceptance of our proposed treatment. Those who fully accept and reject are in the minority, and most people hold a neutral attitude.This questionnaire has timely solved some problems of our team and pointed out the direction of our future work.
Ⅰ. Public understanding for the intestinal disease and IBD is insufficient, we need to do some of the other more popular science activities to publicize the relevant information, improve the awareness of the public.
Ⅱ. The selection of drugs and treatment design needs to consider a number of factors, we should collect more social opinions, trying to make an effective, safe and easy way of treatment for those people in need.
After completing the investigation and the design of the preliminary scheme, we want to make some changes in the current situation of low recognition of inflammatory bowel disease among the youth groups. So we delivered a presentation about IBD, synthetic biology, iGEM competitions as well as our programs into more people's lives. To the end, we made a three - fold booklet and poster. We not only distribute our reading materials in public places such as communities and libraries near the campus but also put our reading materials on the reading shelves in the hospital halls and beside the school medical room, hoping that more people can learn about IBD and synthetic biology.
			Nearly 100 brochures were distributed to introduce the use of synthetic biology to treat IBD. Many people were impressed by our original intentions and behaviors, and expressed their support and admiration for us. Some even expressed their sympathy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.On July 26th, we came to the Northeast Yucai High School in Liaoning Province to give a speech to the third-grade students who are about to enter the university. We detailed the iGEM competition, knowledge about synthetic biology and our projects. Many high school students were interested in biology. They asked questions actively and enthusiastically, and we had conducted more in-depth exchanges.
We also taught high school students to do a DNA gel electrophoresis with the plasmids constructed in our project. The basic operation of molecular biology experiment has aroused everyone's strong interest in biological experiments.

			We went to the inpatient department of Shengjing hospital affiliated to China Medical University to interview a patient with ulcerative colitis(UC) to learn more about IBD.
			The 64-year-old patient was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2016. This is the second time she has been hospitalized for severe illness when we came to her. Through the visit, we learned that:
Ⅰ. Ulcerative colitis seriously affected her life. She had chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea, poor energy, and inconvenient use of the toilet. When coming on, defecate is accompanied with hematic frequently, a dietary difficulty made her complement nutrition with fluid food only. She is depressed all day long.
Ⅱ. The illness comes up repeatedly and the treatment cycle is long as well as expensive. Because it's a lifelong illness and you need to take a pill every day after being hospitalized. Better drugs like biologics are expensive, even up to about 10,000 USD a month. Less effective drugs are not covered by Medicare. Coupled with the repeated illness needs to be looked after by the family and society has brought a burden. The financial and mental burden of an inflammatory bowel disease patient is enormous.
Later, doctors also told us that there has always been a large number of patients who have got inflammatory bowel disease, while more than 20 IBD patients in a floor of this inpatient department. Crohn's disease primarily affects young people while ulcerative colitis occurs at all ages. Patients are more likely to choose medication and few will undergo surgery.
The interview exposed problems with existing treatments, such as the difficulty of effectively curing IBD for long. The rapid spread of inflammatory bowel disease is taking a huge toll on individuals, families and society. It also presents huge health risks, as more and more people are getting sick and the situation will only get worse if they are not dealt with in time. Patients and society are looking forward to the emergence of a new type of treatment. Our team should not blindly pursue curative effect when designing the scheme, but also consider the economic benefits and accompanying risks.

			In addition to IBD patients, we want everyone to have a healthier gut. So we're going to grow broccoli this fall. Thanks to the efforts of our team members, we successfully cooperated with the university to open up a small field of broccoli on the unbuilt campus wasteland.
			Broccoli is not only our source of sulforaphane, but also an accepted healthy dish.We plan to distribute our broccoli to IBD patients, campuses and surrounding communities, hoping that people will pay attention to gut health and develop healthier eating habits.



Thanks for everyone’s time and support. We believe that more and more people will pay more attention to their intestinal health in the future and give more care and understanding to IBD patients, be interested in synthetic biology, and be willing to contribute to the cause of human health.

NEU China A,Human Practices, Integrated HP ,"After completing our survey of youth groups, we consulted professor Sheng finished his Ph.D. degree at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a post-doctoral degree at Harvard Medical School. He is now a professor at theInstitute of Biotechnology, School of life science and health in Northeastern University. He is majoring in Wnt signaling pathway. Sheng was 2016 overseas tutor of NEU-CHINA team. Besides, he is an expert on colorectal cancer and has some knowledge of most bowel diseases.
			He made the following Suggestions for our project design:
Ⅰ. Looking for the right chassis,  E. coli Nissle can be used as chassis
Ⅱ. Select the nitric oxide as inflammatory bowel disease of nonspecific inflammation signal molecules
III. Sustained and stable output is required for anti-inflammatory devices.

			After choosing interleukin-10 as the output of engineering bacteria and conducting experiments for a period of time, in order to find out the feasibility of our scheme, we went to consult with professor Zheng Changqing, a first-line expert in intestinal diseases. He is the director of the department of internal medicine of Shengjing hospital affiliated to China Medical University and the director of the second department of gastroenterology.
			Dr. Zheng Changqing introduced the treatment of IBD from the aspects of patients' disease, current clinical treatment methods, and common drugs.
Ⅰ. Doctors say using bacteria to secrete TNF an immune inhibitor is an effective way.
Ⅱ. Compared to mammalian cells, bacteria are more easy to operate and mass culture. They have more potential. However, the issue of safety should be carefully considered and bioprotective measures should be taken to avoid biological leakage.
III. Common anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used in patients with mild to moderate symptoms, and immunosuppressive agents are more commonly used in patients with Crohn's disease.
Ⅳ. We know that IBD and diet and the changes of intestinal bacteria strains.
During the communication, we also learned that the prevalence of IBD in China has skyrocketed in recent years, and currently the number of effective drugs is limited. Expensive biologics are not covered, and patients rely on ordinary anti-inflammatory drugs. It will be very meaningful if our therapy can be applied effectively in clinical practice. Inspired by professor Zheng, in the future, we will combine engineered bacteria to release immunosuppressive and TNF monoclonal antibodies.


			Based on our treatment plan for inflammatory bowel disease, our team designed a simple game. In the game, players play engineered bacteria that travel through the fire-filled gut, collecting nitric oxide emitted by inflammation and releasing the drug interleukin 10 to destroy the flame to help the gut recover. The upper right dial shows the health of the gut, the left is healthy and the right is critically ill. In difficult circumstances, our  E. coli needs to fight not only IBD but also colorectal cancer. Fighting, warriors!
			On August 27, we attended the fifth CCiC held by ShanghaiTech university.
			We presented our project at this meeting and had communication with other iGEM teams.
			While communicating with the SJTU-BioX-shanghai team, we learned about another pathway of perceived nitric oxide-mediated by the promoter PyeaR. We wanted to compare the performance differences between the promoter PyeaR they used and the promoter PnorV we used later. In addition, an iGEMer introduced the improved SYNB1618 strain obtained by  E. Coli Nissle  1917 with better safety. We are prepared to use this strain in the future. Through this meeting, we made a lot of friends and got a lot of useful advice.
			We wanted to make the lab work available to the market one day, so we asked ourselves if there was a possibility of mass production of the drug in our program. It is what we need to think about. With such an issue in mind, we visited pharmaceutical companies.
			While some of our outreach to our community was short-term, we worked closely with our community partners to ensure that our impact does not end with this project. We will construct an organization aiming to learn more about IBD and other intestinal disease,and to devoted ourselves into the cause of provoking people's awareness of these diseases.
			During the whole process, the researchers introduced to us the production method of the drug Zhengchangsheng, which inspired us to make our engineered bacteria into capsules for oral use by patients in the future.

NTNU Trondheim,Integrated Human Practices,Conclusion,"The human practices part of our project provided us with a lot of new knowledge and ideas that we applied to our project. More importantly, it allowed us to come into contact with our community and increase both our and public awareness on the various problems caused by biofilm-producing bacteria. The main idea at the start of our project was to reduce biofilm formation in bacteria and thus make them more susceptible to antibiotics. During the course of the Human Practices part of our project we learned a great deal about other areas in need of an effective biofilm reducing method, such as dental care, diabetes, prostheses surgery, diagnostics and aquaculture. A variety of treatments for biofilm are available as of today, however they all seem to have their limitations. Our approach to biofilm removal is unique in that bacteriophages have an ability to evolve, meaning that bacteria most likely wouldn’t be able to develop resistance for a long time. If successful, our method could be a potential breakthrough in the field of biofilm-reducing agents.We want to thank all the experts for taking the time to talk with us. Their perspectives opened up our eyes for a whole new world of biofilm-related problems that we had no idea about prior to our project. We also got quite a few useful tips that we implemented in our lab procedures, such as the use of Crystal Violet Assay for biofilm quantification. "
NTNU Trondheim,Integrated Human Practices,Marthe Lind Kroknes,Biomedical laboratory scientist at St.Olavs hospital
NTNU Trondheim,Integrated Human Practices,Summary of interview,"Our initial thought was to use bacteriophages to deliver the CRISPRi system targeting the luxS gene, which is involved in the bacterial quorum sensing. To learn more about the use of phages and their potentials we reached out to Hans Petter Kleppen, one of relatively few with phage experience here in Norway.Hans has a solid background in Molecular Biology, which he gained through his master’s degree at The University of Bergen. In his doctoral degree he studied the occurrence of bacteriophages in diary facilities, where bacteriophage infections can reduce both yield and quality of the desired fermented products. Despite this encounter with the negative effects of bacteriophages, Hans also recognized their potentials as something positive. Today Hans works as the research director in Nordli Holding, which is a firm aiming to increase the health and welfare of fish. As a part the solution, they use bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics. He also informed us about the nanobiome (viriome), which is the viral counterpart to the microbiome. The nanobiome is essential to maintain the balance of the microbiome in an organism and prevents the development of dominance by one single bacteria. With the knowledge of the nanobiome, it may be possible to specifically control the microbiome to increase the health and wealth of the host organism.Even though Hans has mainly worked with natural bacteriophages, he still thinks our approach to constructing and using recombinant phages may theoretically be possible. He also gave us some input to improvements of our experimental setup. In addition to the biofilm reducing selective marker, he suggested us to design a second gRNA that targets a specific antibiotic resistance gene carried by the host bacteria. The degree of antibiotic sensitivity after phage infection can then be used as a measure of the phage infectivity and the effectiveness of the CRISPRi system. This may be an easier and more accurate method compared with the Crystal Violet assay. We probably do not have time to conduct this suggestion, but this could be implemented in future work.Lastly, Hans gave us some insight into the public scepticism and legal restrictions regarding the use of bacteriophages. He informed us that he had met an impressively low amount of scepticism – The key is to spread knowledge about the natural occurrence of phages and the positive effects they can have. Regarding legal restrictions he told us that it strongly depends on the usage and claims of the product. Since our potential product falls within the therapeutic section, it is among others essential to extensively evaluate it’s positive and negative effects on both the environment and health as well as document the therapeutical effects it claims to have. Due to our product being GMO, he told us that it may be even more regulations involved in legalizing our phage delivered CRISPRi system for medical usage. This led us on to dig deeper into the GMO restrictions here in Norway, and we decided to contact Bioteknologirådet (The Biotechnology Council)."

NTNU Trondheim,Integrated Human Practices,Summary of Interview,"We interviewed Kåre Bergh, professor at «Institute of Clinical and Molecular Medicine» at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim, Norway. Kåre has previously worked with infections, microbiology and immunology, and currently works with diagnostics. In our interview, Kåre gave us interesting and detailed insights regarding prosthetics operations and the risk of bacterial contamination during the operation. Infections can actually occur years after a prosthetics surgery, and can be discovered due to indications that the prosthetics has detached.This is caused by low-virulent bacteria in biofilm that gives rise to non or modest symptoms of inflammation. This makes it difficult to diagnose and the biofilm would have to be discovered, removed and grown in the lab to be able to identify the bacteria. Only 1-2 % of the patients with hip prostheses is infected with biofilm-producing bacteria, but it is very unfortunate for those who do. After a few years, often between 1-2 years, the prosthetic has accumulated dangerous levels of bacteria in a biofilm matrix.  Consequently, the prosthetic must be removed through another surgery and replaced with a new one. This is very stressful for the patient, as well as expensive. There is no revolutionary way to treat biofilm on prostheses. We were curious to know Kåres opinion on the E. coli strain (TG1) that we chose as our biofilm producing bacteria to be used in our future Crystal Violet Assay experiments (Biofilm Quantification). Kåre told us that there is no guarantee that a bacterium known for a low, medium or high biofilm production actually will produce the expected amount of biofilm. It largely depends on the growth medium that we use. According to Kåre, a proper glucose concentration is the most important criteria to induce the right amount of biofilm production in our chosen E. coli strain. Biofilm formation in nature and in the laboratory is not the same.
In addition, Kåre made us rethink our experimental procedure in quantifying biofilm produced by E. coli. We initially planned to use a protocol for a Crystal Violet Assay and described the approach to him. He questioned the protocols reliability and found a new protocol which he found more reliable (See Protocols -> Crystal Violet).
We gained more knowledge about biofilm and the problems it can cause on prosthetics. In addition, Kåre made us aware of the flaws in our original protocols for biofilm quantification, and consequently we went with the alternative protocol that he had recommended. As another result of the interview, we performed a test on LB and M63B1 medium to see what glucose and pH values were optimal for biofilm formation in E. coli Dh5α and TG1 strains. His advice benefited us a lot by allowing us to produce significant amounts of biofilm and therefore enabling us to see whether CRISPRi had an inhibitory effect or not. "

 Building Upon Our Past
				","
					Our project started from expanding the use of truncated dCas9 system we developed last year, a compact dCas9-VPR domain with its binding efficiency retained to facilitate gene activation. To expand it further, we planned to fuse this truncated Cas9 protein with DNA base editors to perform efficient DNA base change with a small protein size, potentially useful for gene editing. However, as we dived into our human practice and tried to understand its social impacts, our project has evolved greatly beyond this.
"
NTU-Singapore,Integrated Human Practice,"
 Things Besides Science
				","
					As we were exploring the technical aspect of DNA editing, we realized that the social influence of the CRISPR/Cas technology is equally profound and important to our local community, as well as to Southeast Asia. 

					Singapore, being a very technologically forward country, has already envisioned gene therapy with the CRISPR/Cas system as an indispensable part of our future. For example, last year, Merck has already been issued a patent for chromosomal integration of donor DNA with the CRISPR/Cas system as a therapy [1]. Similarly, just June this year, mitochondrial replacement therapy has also taken its first step into the legalization process in Singapore, making her possibly the second country in the world legalizing such treatment [2]

					Also, crowned for having the highest quality of healthcare in Southeast Asia, Singapore is also a popular destination for medical tourism. Just September this year, taxi companies in Singapore have seen a five-fold increase in the number of tourist passengers going to local hospitals [3].
				
					As such, we personally felt the great importance of this conversation about gene editing in Singapore. Not only just researchers, but working adults, youths and even citizens of other Southeast Asian countries also hold an important piece of the puzzle in the implementation of gene editing in Singapore. Therefore, we decided to make more people aware of the gene editing technologies and to collect their opinions, taking off in our journey of human practice.
"

					Through our human practice, we planned to achieve the following:      1. To educate the public about CRISPR/Cas technology and gene editing. A better understanding would make     our society more prepared for such a choice in the future.      2. To explore and investigate the public attitude towards gene editing and our research, identifying unforeseen      concerns from the public regarding this technology.     3.

 Summary
				","
					Through our human practice, not only did we engage with the public to inform them more about gene editing but we also have learned a lot about their thoughts and considerations in making such a decision. Such a two-way communication with both personal interactions and a scientific survey allowed us to have an accurate portrayal of the public attitude without losing the human touch. The final results of the human practice were both tangible and experiential. It has evolved our project to be more aligned with the public concerns, all of our members also personally realized the huge responsibility of conducting research that is so close to the heart of people’s lives. In the end, we convinced ourselves that our project would bring true meanings to our community, and this would not be possible without our human practice.
"

 Interaction with Dimensions
				","

					Firstly, not only did we actively engage with different stakeholders in our local community about gene editing and educated the local public to obtain meaningful opinions about their acceptance towards the technology, our engagement has been expanded to a much larger region outside Singapore. 
 We are aware that Singapore is a country of a limited landscape but with great regional and international influence, thus our efforts in education and collecting opinions, cannot afford to be limited to our local community. Moreover, as Singapore is the popular destination for medical tourism in Asia, we felt that it is important to reach out to as many citizens in the region about gene editing and hearing all of the different opinions. To achieve this, we collaborated with the University of Indonesia, which helped us to organize a public education and engagement for our project in Indonesia. On top of that, we also conducted our survey in three different countries of Singapore, Indonesia, and China, taking our project to a geographic scale far beyond Singapore.

Also, our public engagement is aiming for our future. As part of our public education, we purposely reached to the young adults at National Junior College. We aimed both to obtain innovative opinions from young minds, which was later proven to be of great value for the progress of our project, as well as to inspire the youths of the nation to participate in and contribute to the future development of gene editing technologies, which was a great success as indicated by the huge interest of and numerous questions from the participants. Moreover, as part of our professional interview, we interviewed a group of training doctors in addition to seasoned ones in practice. While the experienced doctors are definitely more knowledgeable and are better experts to advise us, we believe that it is equally important to hear what future doctors think of our project, as they will be the ones facing the patients and advising them about the therapy. The feedback was indeed of thought-provoking and inspired us to further improve our research. 
"

 Rigorous Study of Our Society
				","
					Any conclusion drawn from the public must be rigorous, otherwise, a fallacious or oversimplified inference could lead the project to a wrong direction. We refused to comfortably accept the initial observations from our engagement as the audience that we interacted only constitutes a small demographic profile, and the sample size is too small to draw a convincing conclusion. To investigate the most current public opinion about gene editing in our region, we later conducted a survey carefully designed to minimize bias and elicited more than 500 responses from three selected countries —Singapore, Indonesia, and China. Proper data analysis was then conducted to discover the trend, establish correlation and validate the conclusion. Not only did our survey highlight to us what the preferred choice of gene editing is in our local community and the importance of different factors in decision making, but through contrasting with other nations, it also measured the relative level of acceptance of Singaporeans towards gene editing as compared to the region. Such a transnational analysis really helped us to gauge the local attitude towards gene editing in Singapore and advised us about the essential aspects to improve our project. With a scientific survey method, we are assured of the validity and justifiability of our conclusion, which would lead our project in the right direction.
"
NTU-Singapore,Best Human Practice,"
 At the Heart of Our Project
				","
					Ultimately, it is the people who will benefit from our research. What the people think is really important as the public’s attitude plays an indispensable role in affecting government decisions, as seen from Singapore’s dialogue with the public regarding implementation of mitochondrial replacement therapy. Therefore, it is essential that we incorporate public interest into the early stage of our research to allow for its potential application in the future. The initial design of our project was only focused on achieving base editing in DNA. However, after a series of public engagement activities, we have learned more about the public interest — RNA editing and integrated it into our project. After hearing from medical professionals about their concerns regarding the high cost of RNA sequencing in future diagnosis, we further improved our project by including an efficient, less costly RNA sequencing techniques. As such, our human practice evolved our project to explore new solutions that better serve the need of the people. It is truly remarkable that we reached so much further than what we started off along the way, with human practice being a driving force and playing a principal role at every turning point of our journey. Such a transformation made our human practice an indeed integral part of our project.

 Conclusion
				","
					For the reasons mentioned above, we feel that our human practice not only satisfies the criteria for medals but also epitomizes how researchers should engage in conversations with the rest of our society. First, with both scientific survey and interpersonal interaction, we believe our findings in human practice is generalizable yet retains the human touch. Second, by having discussions with all stakeholders in gene editing, we obtained a good understanding of the big situation, and conduct research that stays connected with society. Last,  by targeting our human practice at a larger geographic scale and even time scale, our project will not only be catering to the need of the people here and now, but also the people in the entire world in the time ahead.

 Summary
				","
					Our human practice started with the growing conversation about gene editing in Singapore. We felt a great responsibility to collect different voices from the local public on gene editing and evaluate the possible social responses to our project. As such, we sought out two opportunities to reach out to our community.

					One of them is the Pint of Science festival, where local citizens from all walks of life gather together in a casual setting to discuss scientific innovation and technology, and the other one is targeted to the youth in Singapore at the career day of National Junior College (NJC). In these events, we hope to introduce to our target audience about the latest technologies of gene editing with CRISPR and hear their thoughts and considerations in receiving such a technology. Click on the tabs below to see what we have learned from there.
"
NTU-Singapore,Engagement & Outreach,"
 Objectives
				","
					In this event, we had the advantage to directly interact with our audience, to discuss in depth on the topic of gene editing and find out their opinions. Through the interactions, we want to achieve the folllowing:

•  To introduce the emerging gene editing with CRISPR for its relevance as a future therapy.

•  To understand the public attitude and acceptance towards gene editing in different uses. 

•  To know more about their concerns and hesitations regarding gene editing. 
"
NTU-Singapore,Engagement & Outreach,"
 Event Summary
				","
					We engaged about 200 students, teachers and parents by introducing our project and the implications of gene editing. We discussed some key issues on gene therapy via editing DNA and RNA. We collected their opinions through a refined survey after consulting with science communication professors. A more detailed report of the event can be found here.


"

 Key Facts
","
					The participants find gene editing a very powerful tool for disease treatment, and they think that it has the potential to cure or prevent many diseases including cancer. However, the participants do not support for trait enhancement purpose, as they fear that the technology would go unregulated.

					Most of the participants choose RNA editing for disease treatment because it is relatively safer. Majority of the students expressed their concern over the permanent side effects of DNA editing if there are off-targets or unknown consequences. However, there are still concerns about the cost of RNA editing if it requires multiple treatments.

					From analysis of the survey sample, safety and cost are the biggest concerns, and more people favor RNA editing over DNA editing.
"
NTU-Singapore,Engagement & Outreach,"
 Our Takeaway
				","
					As most of our work was based on DNA editing using CRISPR/Cas9, to better align with the public interest of desiring a safer approach to edit their genes, we started to explore ways for RNA editing. We also started to think of how could we improve our current DNA-editing to make it safer and more accepted by the general public. 

					To gain a deeper understanding of public opinion, we decided to engage more with the public and to collect their opinions through a scientific survey. We felt that only by proper analysis of a sufficiently large sample of survey data can we obtain a convincing enough conclusion.
"
NTU-Singapore,Engagement & Outreach,"
 Motivation
				","
					On the career day at National Junior College, we had the opportunities to target young adults in Singapore to get an idea of their thoughts on the topic of gene editing. In the event, our aims are

•  To survey the youth demographic and understand their attitude towards gene editing.

•  To understand if students with biology background view such technologies differently.
"
NTU-Singapore,Engagement & Outreach,"
 Our Takeaways
","
					From two small samples, we were confident that RNA editing would be a more popular choice by the public. Therefore, we started to think of what we could contribute to research in RNA editing. We were also ready to formally expand our survey to the national or even to the international level to see if results differ.
"
NTU-Singapore,Engagement & Outreach,"
 Conclusion
				","
					After our engagement with both the working adults and the youth in Singapore, we felt two things are necessary. Considering the vast diversity of the Singaporean population, there are more people from all walks of lives to be considered. Whether they are young immigrants or senior citizens and regardless of their social-economic background, it is possible for everyone to face such choices in their time. Also, being a popular destination for premium medical tourism, our choices regarding gene therapy also affect many more in this region. Hence, it would be necessary to compare the local attitude with other countries in the region, making sure that the Singapore society shares a similar view as the region. As such, these remaining questions and second thoughts motivated us to take our human practice to the next step.

Oxford,Human Practices, Overview ," An important aspect of synthetic biology is the consideration of how the technology has applications in the context of the wider society. We believe that collaborating with scientists, clinicians, social scientists, patients and the general public is essential to ensuring that our product benefits society. Our approach to human practices involved working with professionals, patients and the public to understand their opinions about various aspects of our project, and using this feedback to alter the design of our project and tailor our educational outreach activities. The focus of our work on human practices was to integrate four major themes: 
 - Applied Design  
 Our approach to applied design involved creating surveys and interviewing patients to analyse the unmet patient needs and the most important issues that require addressing to improve patients’ quality of life. Regular conversations with patients, as well as professionals experienced in law, manufacture and clinical delivery of therapeutics, enabled our design to continually evolve in light of this feedback.  - Public Engagement and Outreach   As a field still in its infancy, public knowledge of synthetic biology is limited and is often viewed with scepticism. As a result, public acceptance of genetically engineered therapeutics will be restricted by public knowledge unless educational resources are provided. The provision of summer school classes, public outreach events, online resources and a long-term public education plan were parts of our public outreach efforts. Our public engagement was integrated with our work covering applied design, as we remained open to feedback and used guidance from the public to shape our product design.
 - Entrepreneurship   Our focus on entrepreneurship was a way of understanding how our therapeutic could be transitioned from the lab into the real world. We interviewed IBD patients and other key decision makers to determine the best value proposition. We surveyed the public about their preferences for potential products, and considered patents and regulatory procedures governing how our therapeutic can be taken into market.   - Safety  
 Safety is an essential consideration for the design of any genetically modified organism, particularly those used as medications. Discussions with clinicians and researchers, as well as some of the questions raised by patients and public we spoke to, encouraged us to make safety a key focus of our integrated human practices. Taking on the advice of professionals, we developed different designs of a kill switch and modeled the safety risks associated with our design.  Detailed information about our work centred around each of the four themes can be found on the respective pages of our wiki. 
"
Oxford,Human Practices,Overview of Integrated Human Practices ," Our philosophy regarding human practices was to ensure a reciprocal relationship between our team and society, ensuring that we remain open to feedback from the public, patients and professionals. Our human practices work involved the education of the wider public about our project ideas and the broader applications of synthetic biology, as well as discussions and interviews to understand society’s opinions of our project. We acted upon the feedback we received, meaning that our project continually evolved in light of the public’s input. An important focus of our work was to ensure that ‘society’ encompassed the broadest range of individuals, so we engaged with clinicians, researchers, professionals involved in the legal and business side of drug development, patients, students and the lay public. 
 In this manner, our vision and plans for human practices were altered throughout the course of the project. The timeline below summarises our work for human practices and demonstrates how engaging with different individuals prompted us to take alternative pathways in the project, both in terms of human practices and the design of our therapeutic. 
"
Oxford,Human Practices, First Survey ,"When we were first coming up with a project we involved the public by reaching out from our social media with a survey. We assessed the general awareness of genetic engineering and asked which real-world issue they believed should be the focus of our project.The overwhelming majority of survey participants picked therapeutics as an area of priority, this influenced the development of our project into a therapeutic based idea from our initial ideas."
Oxford,Human Practices, Patient Consultation ,"After deciding on which issue we should work on we came across autoimmune diseases and believed current treatments are not sufficient. To ensure this was the case we consulted patients and clinicians and asked specific problems that result from the disease and current treatments
Patient Interviews Engaging with patients - the end-users of our product - was important for understanding the unmet patient needs that we are aiming to rectify. This gave us an insight into what features will be important in the design of the product, although it became apparent that it would be beneficial to conduct one-to-one patient interviews to gain a greater understanding of the specific impact of the disease on patients’ quality of life. Taking on advice from clinicians, as well as the apparent range of symptoms associated with different autoimmune diseases, we chose to focus our product on the treatment of IBD. As a widely accepted method of “gaining insight into people’s feelings, understanding and perceptions”, one-to-one interviews played an important role in understanding the issues that our product must rectify to have the most significant benefit to patients’ quality of life.We have gone into more depth on the conduction and results of patient interviews in our product design section. The results clearly show current treatments are not sufficient. The main points we took away from the interviews are that patients seek treatments that reduce flare-ups, have fewer long term side effects and less of an impact on social life. This greatly aided in the development of our device.

  Autoimmune Disease Survey  
We sent out a survey for patients with autoimmune diseases in order get a better idea of what patients would like from a treatment. We received 48 responses from members of the public suffering from autoimmune diseases from a range of age groups. The responses gave us a greater understanding of the current treatments, the problems with them and what patients would like from a treatment. We were astounded by the positivity towards GE and for our project. There is a great deal of belief from the public in the potential of GE in medicine.They survey told us the public wanted a treatment that treats “a condition at its source rather than masking symptoms.” that was also “less invasive and less dangerous”. They also showed support of a device that was able to provide personalised doses according to the patient. This led to the initial design of our treatment."
Oxford,Human Practices, Developing  our design ,Having received feedback from patients we learnt what was sought after in a novel treatment. We then reached out to specialists to comment on the initial design of our device in order to maximise the efficacy of our treatment based on current knowledge on the immune system and IBD.
Oxford,Human Practices,Safety,"Patient interviews, surveys and consultations with specialists highlighted the need to incorporate a biosafety mechanism into our device. We responded to this feedback by designing, synthesising and characterising a single component kill switch. More can be read about this on improvement of a part and our safety pages. On top of this in order to encourage the use of GM probiotic treatments for a greater range of conditions.
"
Oxford,Human Practices,Regulation,"  Dr Michael Morrison - Centre for Health, Law and Emerging Technologies (HELEX)  
 Over the summer we met with Dr Morrison on multiple occasions to discuss the law and regulations that would be relevant to the development of our product. He gave us guidance on the various regulations that would govern how our product could be used clinically, and gave us an understanding of the processes required during clinical trials. The work with Dr Morrison was incredibly important in the creation of our proposal on the safety of GM probiotics, a long-term public education plan, and theoretical plans for completing clinical trials and the manufacture of our probiotic. Dr Morrison was also able to guide us towards information on a range of gene therapy case studies as mentioned on product design. He also put us in contact with Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult.
Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult
Catapult is a centre to help and encourage growth of cell and gene therapies by aiding with regulation, product testing, logistics, manufacture and business advice.We met with Daniel Rabbie, the Regulatory Affairs Manager, and Ryan McCoy, the Senior Process Development Scientist to discuss how our product fits in with current government regulations and how we can take it from the lab to the patients. We discussed the differences in regulation in different therapies, the organisations available to speed up the process of getting the treatment from the lab to the patient, current therapies, and considerations involving logistics and manufacture."
Oxford,Human Practices,ATMP Classification,"The classification of treatment is important in determining the right regulatory bodies you must go through. Our treatment would likely count as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) according to the European Medical Agency (EMA). The EMA’s Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) advise on whether a treatment would be considered an ATMP and what type it would be, such as a cell or gene therapy. We found a previous therapy involving modified Lactococcus lactis engineered to produce anti-TNF alpha antibody fragment for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. From this we can assume our treatment would be classified as a gene therapy medicinal product. To confirm this we have submitted an application for ATMP classification with CAT from the EMA which we are waiting to hear back from. More information on reasons for this classification as well as our submitted form can be found on the product design section. We believe the form can be used as a reference for others seeking classification of new types of medicinal therapy in the EU."
Oxford,Human Practices,Delivery,"As a new type of medicinal product it is also important to determine how we can successfully deliver the device to the gut.We had been considering how our product would be delivered to the gut from early on the project. Our aim was to develop a 'friendlier' treatment but it is important to consider the possibilities for a probiotic in order to maximise the likelihood of colonisation in the gut. Further details on delivery can be found in product design.Psychological Impact
Our initial survey highlighted the importance of the delivery method in a psychological way as well as functionally. Patients told us they would like a treatment which is simpler than their current treatments especially compared to having to be on an IV. We were told that the patients found the use of needles for biological treatments can scary especially for younger patients. We were also informed how these psychological considerations are particularly important for chronic conditions compared to other conditions. For this reason, we decided to place a greater focus on the method of treatment and try to ensure we come up with the easiest and safest method for the patient.Surveys
As well as consultation with specialists we conducted surveys with the public and members of the Oxford Biochemistry Department to gain an insight of how people would like to have treatments administered and why. We initially received support for packaging the product in a yoghurt in our first survey. We conducted two surveys with the aim of finding the preferred delivery method of the public. Our first survey was conducted at ‘Meet the Experts’ at Oxford University Museum of Natural History and our second was sent out to members of the Oxford Biochemistry department. The first was at an event for children and families whilst the second was completed by specialists with a higher level of understanding of GMOs.The most favoured method in the Natural History Museum survey was the yoghurt drink. Injections received many votes but only from children under 12 either because of association of injections with effectiveness or because they found the idea of injections exciting.From our survey in the department we were able to ask a significantly larger group of people their opinion as well as receiving reasons for their choices. Capsules resulted as the favoured method from this survey. Yoghurts received votes due to their convenience but capsules was preferred for the same reason as well as its establishment in medicine, ease of storage and transport, and its superior half-life."
Oxford,Public Engagement,Overview,"Keeping in line with the principles of synthetic biology, we aimed to make our research accessible to all members of society through the development of a range of educational resources. Many of the misconceptions and scepticism of synthetic biology are the result of a lack of public understanding of the field and the inability of researchers and industries to “initiate open discussions”. Our initial outreach activities involved the delivery of lessons and workshops for summer school students, and we drew upon the feedback from these activities to plan further outreach events and resources designed for a larger target audience. Equally, these activities enabled us to assess the level of knowledge that the public have about synthetic biology, and discover their opinions about this emerging research field and, more specifically, our project.

The design of our educational programmes were guided by the synthetic biology educational aims outlined by Kuddell et al (2007):
"
Oxford,Public Engagement,"
"," In line with recommendations to develop “much-needed approachable synthetic biology web resources” in EraSynBio’s Strategic Vision 2014, we focused on generating online resources to act as accessible educational tools for school children and the public.  Oxplore is a digital platform designed by University of Oxford to encourage school students aged 11-18 to look beyond the normal school curriculum and engage in further research in a variety of fields. We created a podcast introducing the principles of genetic engineering and its common applications, the aim of our project and the ethical implications of gene editing. The podcast was promoted by various outreach organisations in Oxford, as well as on our own social media accounts. Our podcast can be listened to here: Oxford Sparks is an online resource dedicated to advertising Oxford’s scientific research and encouraging young people to consider a career in STEM subjects. Their website contains a range of resources to support teachers to make science engaging for students, as well as showing an insight into the lives of researchers. We collaborated with Oxford Sparks to promote careers in synthetic biology to young people, including running a ‘iGEM Twitter Takeover’. During the Takeover, we tweeted photos of our work during the day, including the lab work, online research and outreach events. Through this, we hope to have promoted our research in an accessible way, as well as demonstrating the collaborative and diverse nature of scientific research.   
 In addition to the online educational resources aimed at school students, we engaged in work to promote our project and genetic engineering to adult audiences. The Oxford Scientist Blog is aimed at university students, staff and the general public to address current ideas in the science field as well as research that is being undertaken at the university. We wrote an article for the blog to explain our project and how genetically engineered probiotics may have applications in modern medicine. The blog article can be viewed: hereAdditionally, we wrote an article that featured in Phenotype Journal - a science magazine produced by Oxford University Biochemical Society - to explain our project and our involvement in the UK iGEM Meet Up. "
Oxford,Public Engagement,Long-term Education Plan," Based on our outreach work, it was clear that the general public has an insufficient understanding of genetic engineering and are therefore unable to make truly informed decisions about using genetically engineered medical products. Informed consent is a complex ethical concept that plays an important role in the research and clinical practice, describing the fact that a patient must be fully informed about the treatment and its associated benefits and risks before opting whether to take the medication. Since the information about both probiotics and genetic engineering is commonly misunderstood by the general public, the production and use of our treatment should be accompanied by a drive to educate the public about these issues.  We believe that assessing the problems associated with public acceptance of GM foods, where the introduction of GM foods into Europe “prompted major conflict”, is vital to the development of effective strategies to ensure public acceptance of genetically engineered probiotics. The European introduction of GM foods has been heavily criticised due to the failure of researchers, industry and public authorities to “address concerns prevailing among the general public”. In order to prevent a scenario like this, we recognise the value of engaging the wider public to understand their concerns and then to act upon these in an open and honest way. Our ultimate aim is to create an accessible platform to enable an open dialogue about concerns and solutions between researchers, industries, public authorities and the general public. Our public outreach enabled us to do this on a small scale; feedback gained from patients and the general public highlighted the huge concerns about the safety of a GM probiotic. In response to this, we modified our design to incorporate kill switches and performed additional safety analysis that was presented on our Wiki and at further public outreach events. Our openness about the safety measures we have taken in light of public feedback demonstrates how collaboration between researchers and the public can be achieved to fully meet the needs and address the concerns of the wider public.  The public outreach events that we organised were successful at engaging individuals and increasing their level of understanding of these issues, although a more sustained approach will be needed to educate all members of the public and healthcare professionals. We have created a Long-term Public Education Plan, which outlines a series of steps that will be required to enable the widespread education of the general public, clinicians and patients. The Long-term Public Education Plan provides further guidance for how to maintain an open platform for the public and clinicians to express their concerns about using GM probiotics, thus ensuring that public concerns are understood and acted upon throughout the future. Our Long-term Education Plan can be viewed here: "
Oxford,Public Engagement, Probiotic Information Leaflet ," Having identified the lack of public knowledge about probiotics and genetic engineering, we developed an informative leaflet aimed at providing a basic level of understanding to the lay public. The leaflet, shown below, was distributed at our outreach events, such as at the New Scientist Live event and at our stall at Oxford University Museum of Natural History. "
Oxford,Public Engagement, 'Meet the Experts' Session at Oxford University Museum of Natural History ," On 15th September, we hosted a stall at the Museum of Natural History, Oxford for their 'Meet the Experts' exhibition - an scientific outreach event aimed at families. It was also our first opportunity to truly engage with the public due to our progress in applied design, human practices, and experimental results. We held the following interactive activities:"
Oxford,Public Engagement, New Scientist Live ," In September, we teamed up with Imperial iGEM to host an exhibition at New Scientist Live at the ExCel Centre, London. In addition to explaining our individual projects, we made an educational leaflet to improve understanding about synthetic biology, including common laboratory techniques, to distribute to the general public at the event. We also conducted a survey to gauge views on the safety and necessity of different types of genetic modification: somatic cell gene therapy, genetically modified probiotics, and germline cell gene therapy. Visitors were shown a sliding scale and asked to vote on the extent to which they agreed/disagreed with these techniques for therapeutic purposes. The results of our survey, grouped by age category, are as follows:"
Oxford,Public Engagement, UK iGEM Meet-up in Oxford  ," In mid- July, Oxford and SynBio hosted the UK iGEM meetup. Teams travelled from as far as Edinburgh, Cardiff and Exeter to attend this two-day event that promoted collaboration, offered advice and gave an insight into what lies beyond the iGEM competition.  We heard from individuals closely associated with the iGEM foundation and synthetic biology groups in Oxford and attended talks on ‘Safety and Human Practices’, ‘iGEM troubleshooting’ and ‘Entrepreneurship beyond iGEM’. The aforementioned talk, describing the development of a synthetic biology start-up and entrepreneurship within iGEM made a particular impact on the trajectory of our project. Having heard from Dr. Ben Reeve, a previous iGEM participant who has now established his own biotechnology company, we decided that we would attempt the Entrepreneurship track alongside work on our therapeutic. We have now met with a researcher to discuss patent law and the steps required for drug development and approval in the US, EU and other potential markets. We also attended workshops that encouraged a better understanding of organisation and planning and an iGEM troubleshooting session which helped us to understand the tasks we had to accomplish in the time we had remaining. In addition, the principal supervisor of the Imperial 2016 team, Dr. Karen Polizzi, gave a talk on the roles of individuals within the team and how to best utilise the expertise offered by each member. Our team is made up of biochemists, engineers, a chemist, medic and biologist and the diversity in subjects offers different areas of specialism to contribute to the project.  We also had the opportunity to give a short introduction to the work we have been doing this summer and listen to presentations from other teams. This allowed us to identify common elements between our project and those of other teams, which, in turn, led to the opportunity for collaboration. We also saw the vast number of ways in which synthetic biology can be used to solve real-world problems, for example, using RNAi to target crop pest such as aphids, a detection system for Listeria or the development of synthetic spiders’ silk in bacteria. This event was a good opportunity to meet with other UK based iGEM teams as well as chance to form important collaborations that we were able to work on over the rest of the summer. "
Oxford,Public Engagement,Social Media ," Reaching out to the public domain via social media platforms was an essential part to our project. Our regular posting included details of our project and our progress in the lab, as well as promoting both our online and lesson-style outreach work. The social media accounts were successful at engaging the public to complete surveys, as well as serving as a vital tool for communication and collaboration between different iGEM teams. We concentrated on promoting our team as being approachable and open to collaboration with the public and other research groups."
Paris Bettencourt,Public Engagement,Showcasing “Maksim - the Piglet”,"To engage people and to get their feedback, we selected three exhibitions, where we found ample amount of space and support to demonstrate “Maksim - the Piglet”."
Pasteur Paris,Integrated HP,Interview with Dr. Benjamin Bouyer ,"Dr. Benjamin Bouyer’s main concern with our project was how we would be incorporating the biofilm inside the patient. Indeed, every implant is given to the surgeon in a sterile way, inside a bag the doctor would not open until the very last moment. He also brought up the issue of our system being 3 in 1. Indeed, our biofilm would be capable of reducing the risk of infection by Staphylococcus aureus but would also be modified to induce the growth of nerves when needed, all this while conducting a signal. Indeed, our project is focusing on amputated patients, meaning only they would need all the three branches of our system. We reassured him by explaining that our system could also be used only for its inhibition of virulence properties and that it could be open to every type of patient. He did, however, believe that our project could be useful to many branches of medicine. We also asked him if he would, as a surgeon, use our device if the laws changed about the use of GMOs, and his response was very positive. Indeed, in his opinion, no doctor would reject a system proven to reduce infections. "
Pasteur Paris,Integrated HP,Interview with Pr. Jean-Marc Ghigo.,"Pr. Jean-Marc Ghigo was the first professional to talk to us about the formation of biofilms. In addition to his help with lab biofilm growth protocols, he also gave us great advice concerning our device and the confinement of our biofilm. Indeed, biofilms have a tendency to colonize the system and we needed to think of a way to confine them so they don’t disperse in the patient’s body or contaminate other material during the integration of the implant. By confining the biofilm, we would also reduce the chances of bacterial conjugation between possible pathogenic bacteria and ours. "
Pasteur Paris,Integrated HP,"Interview with Dr. Bernard Zalc, Ph.D","Dr. Bernard Zalc is co-leader of the oligodendrocyte development and neurovascular interactions department. He studies oligodendroglial cell development in the embryonic brain and the interactions between neural cells and the cerebral vascular network. 
Dr. Bernard Zalc facilitated our understanding of the nerve growth and explained to us some issues that we could encounter. He gave us some tips regarding nerve growth and the connection between the nerve and our interface. Indeed, for him, other neurotrophins (like BDNF and VEGFA) and chemoattractant molecules are needed in order to attract and direct the growth toward the implanted interface of our system. We exposed to him our experimental approach for the proof of concept and he talked about the importance of the Schwann cells and the myelinization for the conduction.  Moreover, he shared contacts which can help us regarding the modeling parts and the prosthesis. 
 "
Pasteur Paris,Integrated HP,"Interview with Jean-Marc Victor, Ph.D. ","Dr. Jean-Marc Victor was a real help for our modeling team. After presenting him the project, that he was very fond of, he helped us with the modeling of the growth of the neurons when we faced problems. His dynamism and interest for our project really helped us to finish our modeling, and in consequence, our in vitro primary culture. "
Pasteur Paris,Integrated HP,Interview with Jean-Pascal Hons-Olivier ,"Mr. Jean-Pascal Hons-Olivier gave us great input on the different causes of amputation and the relationship between a patient and his prosthetist. He also allowed us to understand what was the process of getting an implant in France, how someone is living with an amputated limb and also gave his opinion on the different type of prosthesis on the market. He also talked about the type of prosthesis our system would integrate into: osseointegrated prostheses. The type of surgery is currently not taken in charge by the French health care system due to the high risk of infection, and breaking of the bone and the prosthesis, and only one surgeon is doing this type of operation in the country: Dr. Marion Bernard. Mr. Hons-Olivier did raise up some concerns about our project being too innovative since only a few industries in the USA are working on bionic prostheses and this type of surgery costs more around 100 000 euros at the moment. "
Pasteur Paris,Integrated HP,"Interview with Dr. Eric DENES, Dr. Evelyn Poli and Dr. Christelle Arico ","Dr. Eric Denes is an infectious diseases specialist at the University Hospital of Limoges and is the scientific director of i.CERAM. Dr. Evelyn Poli is a chemistry research and development engineer and Dr. Christelle Arico is a project manager at i.CERAM. Dr. Eric Denes, as well as Dr. Evelyn Poli and Dr. Christelle, were very interested in our project. They are currently designing new materials in ceramic, titanium, and stainless-steel to test the bacterial adhesion on their prostheses. They warned us about the use of metals for the prostheses since S. aureus and P. aeruginosa tend to form biofilms easily on metals rather than on ceramic. They are also using Gentamicin and Vancomycin charged implants to cure infections. Their system does have a long half-life time (4 days) whereas our biofilm could be a longer-term solution. "
Pasteur Paris,Integrated HP,Interview with Dr. Bernard Geffroy,"We contacted Dr. Bernard Geffroy to learn more about OLED and to see if we could integrate the technology he is currently working on inside the prosthesis. It could be a way to let the patient know if S. aureus is present at the junction site of its osseointegrated prosthesis. Dr. Bernard Geffroy did go along the sayings of Mr. Jean-Pascal Hons Olivier on our project, mentioning it as being a bit innovative for now on. At first, we wanted to know if he thought the integration of a flexible screen inside the prosthesis, letting the patient know at every moment his/her health data, was possible. Dr. Bernard Geffroy did applaud for our ideas but doesn’t think this technology would be on the market for at least 10 or 20 years. He did redirect our ideas towards the use of OLEDs and color codes and was really interested in the following of our project. "
Pasteur Paris,Integrated HP,Contact with Cyril Cartron and Marion Liard,"Cyril Cartron and Marion Liard are two members of the Paris City Hall. Cyril Cartron works for the DICOM (Direction of Information and Communication) and deals with all events organized by the City Hall, especially sporting events. Marion Liard is a project manager in the Town Communication department. Her actions are particularly devoted to handicap. Since NeuronArch is a project directly linked to handicap, we decided to get involved with the Mairie de Paris to make Paris a more accessible town for disabled people by creating new markings and signs in direct connection with the Paralympic games. For this, we contacted the Paris City Hall to make this project in collaboration, especially in preparation for 2024 Paralympics in Paris. First, we contacted Cyril Cartron by phone. He was determined to help us. He gave us the contact of Marion Liard, in charge of handicap events. After some emails, she put us in contact with the cabinet of Nicolas Nordman, deputy mayor of the Paris City Hall, responsible for all issues concerning disabled people and their accessibility. This cabinet will contact us for a conciliation meeting, the December 3rd, to discuss with specialists during the International Handicap Day. Thus, we are eager to do this meeting with them! "
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,Translational Research Day,"The Translational Research Day is a full day small symposium dedicated to translational research. The event was organized at Institut Pasteur (Paris) from 2007 to 2014 by the former Center for Human Immunology. Since 2015, it is organized by the Translational Research Center. This year, it focused on gathering scientists working on neuropsychology, microbiota and angering. We had the pleasure to share our ideas and present to the scientific world for the first time our team’s project NeuronArch through our first poster. "
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,Young Researchers in Life Sciences ,"The Young Researchers in Life Sciences (YRLS) is one of the most important conferences of spring. We participated in the 9th edition conference held from the May 2nd -4th at Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris. Young researchers presented their projects through scientific posters, like we did, and gave us some precious advices on the experiments to come."
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,VIVATECH ,"Viva Technology is a commercial fair dedicated to technological innovations in Paris. On may 24th, we attended the “welcome to the bionic age” conference hosted by David Aguilar Amphoux, Moran Cerf, and Ernesto Martinez Villalpando. During one hour, they spoke about bionic prosthesis and how to make, use and connect them directly to the human brain. "
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,Biofilms 8 ,"Members of our team flew to Denmark to attend Biofilms 8 conference held in May 27-29 in Aarhus University. The conference gathered experts from all around the world in the field of bacterial communities and biofilm way of life. We presented our poster during poster sessions to biologists, doctors, and engineers. This conference allowed us to further exchange with Françoise Van Bambeke, Doctor in Pharmaceutical Science at the University of Louvain, Belgium, who has been working for years on the pharmacological fight against biofilm. Exchanging with her confirmed us that acting on Quorum sensing to avoid biofilm formation could be an efficient approach, and she advised us to try to investigate on the advantages of our synthetic biology approach compared to classic pharmacologic solutions. "
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,ICOE Bordeaux ,"Few members of the team also participated in the 14th International Conference on Organic Electronics being held on June 18-22 in Bordeaux. ICOE brought together the most excellent researchers from the academy as well as industry to discuss fundamental aspects of organic semiconductors, demonstrate their vision of the road-map of organic electronics and to exchange ideas on future materials, technologies and applications. You may ask yourself why our team attended this conference full of physicists and chemists. For our system, we were looking for a membrane capable of confining our biofilm and conduct a signal at the same time. During this 3-days conference, we presented our project during a poster session and met many scientists who advised us to use PEDOT, a conductive polymer and who also advised us on the type of cells we should use, such as Dr. Sahika Inal, assistant professor at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and Dr. Róisín M. Owens, currently engineering for developing in vitro biological models. "
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,Neural Networks – From brains to machines and vice versa ,"The use of neural networks is not confining inside new types of prosthesis. Indeed, continuous advances in machine learning have enabled groundbreaking progress in diverse fields such as computer vision or strategy games by making use of artificial neural networks. In parallel, new technologies for recording and manipulating biological neural networks allow us to probe the behavioral function of neuronal activity in unprecedented detail. This eventorganized by the Institut Pasteur, brought together leading experts in the fields of biology, applied mathematics and physics, aiming to bridge our current understanding of how biological and artificial neural networks operate. Naturally, participating to this event was a major boost for our project NeuronArch. We presented a scientific poster with our results and got really good feedbacks from professionals on how to push it further. "
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,National Science Fair - Fête de la Science 2018,"The National Science Fair is held every year all over France to vulgarize science to children, teenagers, and families. This year the Pasteur Team decided to take part of this event inside the ESPCI engineering school (École Supérieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris), hosting multiple stands around what is DNA and how you can modify organisms with synthetic biology. To illustrate this, we used candies, origami DNA to allow children and the general public to understand the potential of synthetic biology.We organized stands, open for children and adults on different themes: “What is DNA?”, “Creation of Synthetic Biology and GMOs”, “Application of Synthetic Biology”, “iGEM and NeuronArch”. We also developed a game, an interactive comic, to help embody synthetic biology for the youngest attendants, showed them what a bacterial culture looked like and also raised awareness on disabilities on our stand ""NeuronArch"" by challenging children to grab multiple objects without their thumbs.  "
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,Middle School Presentation ,"This initiative was taken to vulgarize and spark vocations to middle schoolers. A few members of our team supervised a middle school class at the Madame de Stael School and presented them the basis of biology, and what synthetic Biology could offer in this day of age. We also supervised them and showed them in a very concrete way what laboratory manipulations are by teaching them protein crystallization."
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,Seminar EvryBio ,"Organized by the 3rd year bachelor’s students of the University Evry-Val-d’Essonne, the event had the ambition to reunite public and private actors of research around vulgarized broad scientific themes. Researchers from the University Evry-Val-d’Essonne and the Genopole (a biopark dedicated to biotechnology and genetic), as well as entrepreneurs in biotechnology, were reunited. The event was also open to high schoolers and the general public. Were presented articles on genetic therapy, treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, the use of phagotherapy and also the potential of synthetic biology. We were invited by the bachelor’s students to present our project NeuronArch during the day, in front of a hundred people crowd composed of high school students, researcher, and engineers. The afternoon, we discussed with professionals and students, presenting them our poster and allowing ideas to flow. "
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement,Body and Prosthesis ,"We participated in the event Body and Prosthesis organized by UPMC Sorbonne University, in Paris. We heard about this event through the association ADEPA. ADEPA stands for “Association de Défense et d’Etude des Personnes Amputés », which translates to « Association for the Defense and Study of Amputated People ». This national association was created in 1996 and aims to unite forces between disabled persons. They are representing the community during ministerial commissions and try to help people in their day to day life with their handicap by giving support and finding solutions. Every year, they organize multiple seminars in the big cities of France such as Strasbourg, Grenoble, and Lyon. We participated in the session organized in Paris on the theme “Assist, Repair and Replace.” We had the pleasure to attend this session, listening to the experiences of doctors, Ph. D students, amputees, and disabled persons. We also presented our project in one slide and gave a poster presentation during the breaks, getting pieces of advice and feedback from doctors and amputees at the same time. "
Pasteur Paris,Education & Engagement, Vulgarized video about our Kill-Switch dedicated to children ,"As we were working on the kill-switch of our device, we noticed that the concept of a ""kill-switch"" wasn't easy to understand, especially for the youngest. We decided to make a small vulgarized video dedicated to explaining what is this important part of synthetic biology. You can find all the information concerning the making of our kill-switch  here ."

Queens Canada,Education & Engagement,Science Rendezvous,"The Kingston Science Rendezvous is an annual event that showcases current research in science and engineering to the community. QGEM saw it as 
    an excellent opportunity to connect with people from different ages and background, and we held a booth that presented some interesting science 
    experiments and demonstrations. At the event we had three stations, the first demonstrated the process of kiwi DNA extraction with household 
    materials. This was meant to establish the idea that science experiments can take place in everyday life and to encourage parents to explore 
    science-related projects with their children at home. The second was a microscope station presenting a set of fruit fly abdomen cross section 
    under the microscope. This was prepared by one of our volunteers and many were impressed by the anatomy of the fruit fly. We took the chance to 
    explain the importance of fruit flies in genetic research and gave children an idea of the variety of work geneticists carry out. Both parents 
    and children had shown great interest as fruit flies are commonly seen in households and yet it was rare for people to be able to see their 
    organs and inner structures. Our microscope set up also featured other prepared slides containing different types of plankton. By allowing 
    participants to use the microscope, they were able to gain a better appreciation for both how this technology works, as well as the microorganisms 
    and microparticles that compose the world we live in. The third component of our booth was the use of a virtual reality (VR) headset with the app 
    InCell VR. This application allowed participants to get an in-depth view of the inside of a human cell at the molecular level. Children were able 
    to see cell components including the nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes during this interactive virtual experience. Although it was difficult 
    to introduce complicated genetic concepts to  young children for the first time, they were as fascinated and intrigued as we were!

Queens Canada,Education & Engagement,Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference (CUTC),"QGEM was invited to attend and participate in the annual Maker’s Fair at the Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference hosted by the University of Waterloo. 
    CUTC is Canada's largest technology conference for undergraduate students established to bring together creators, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, budding 
    scientists and young visionaries across the country. There we were able to interact with and explain potential applications of synthetic biology to students in 
    both high school and post-secondary. The team also highlighted problems tackled by past QGEM teams and briefly outlined recent years’ projects for a better 
    understanding of the work that we do. As well, we were able to collaborate and share our ideas with other design teams from around Ontario.
"
Queens Canada,Education & Engagement,Science Quest,"Something our team has always been passionate about when it comes to synthetic biology is education. We believe that teaching children about the basics of synthetic biology 
    from a young age can not only prepare them for future education but also allow them to explore a potential area of interest that they may want to pursue as a career one day. 
    Although Science Rendezvous provided an opportunity to expose children of various ages to what our team does, and better explore the topic of DNA and cell biology, we were 
    thrilled to partner up with Science Quest at Queen’s University for a more focused session. Science Quest is a not for profit science, technology, engineering and mathematics 
    (STEM) based program that operates at Queen’s University. Fortunately, we were able to lead a short mentorship program for a group of students in grades 6-8 to teach them all 
    about DNA. Our lesson plan consisted of a short presentation outlining what DNA is, how is is transcribed into RNA, followed by the translation process to produce proteins. 
    We started by doing a helix-building exercise to teach about the structure of DNA and how the base pairing between nucleotides works. To do this, we utilized licorice, 
    toothpicks and mini coloured marshmallows for an informative (and yummy) experiment. The second part of our lesson plan was to teach the basics about how DNA codes for 
    different amino acids. By providing them with both the DNA and mRNA sequences, as well as a codon chart and list of amino acids, we created a “DNA code breaker” game for them 
    to play. By using the mRNA, they were able to determine which amino acid it was coding for, and then use the one-letter code to spell out our secret messages. We ended our 
    session with some fun cell biology and DNA trivia.
"
Queens Canada,Education & Engagement,SynBio Club,"QGEM has always had a focus to provide a high-quality research experience to its students and others in the Queen’s University community. During the school semester, 
    QGEM typically runs a SynBio Club to casually discuss novel ideas and showcase research being done at Queen’s by inviting professors to speak. We believe it is 
    essential to create a better understanding of the diverse range of applications synthetic biology has in research, medicine, agriculture, and the environment to 
    truly encompass and express its importance to society.
This year, we extended the club to the summer months, extending our invitation to those within the Kingston community. We created a new series of synthetic biology 
    presentations, each followed by a structured open discussion period. Each hour-long session highlighted a different synthetic biology application and focused on a 
    specific example from a recent scientific publication.
Our first SynBio Club summer 2018 event took place on June 29th and was devoted to better explaining the applications of genetic engineering in the field of medicine. 
    Our Outreach Lead, Maddison, presented a paper that focused on research done at Cornell University. The research team did a study using genetically engineered 
    Escherichia coli as commensal bacteria to prevent Vibrio cholerae virulence in mouse models. By transforming the bacteria to produce an autoinducer molecule, they 
    were able to alter bacterial communication and decrease the amount of cholera present in the mouse systems. This was an excellent example of how synthetic biology 
    applications can impact the field of medicine and even have the potential to serve as a basis for disease prevention and treatment plans. Following the presentation, 
    everyone attending was invited to discuss their views on the application, its potential for use in human systems, possible ethical concerns and considerations that 
    would need to be evaluated if this application was to move forward.

Our second SynBio Club event took place on July 25th and was focused on evaluating the use of synthetic biology in research applications and its effective use as a tool 
    to further academic research. Specifically, the topic of optogenetics, a technique frequently used in neuroscience research, was explored. Optogenetics involves the 
    introduction of genes for light-sensitive channels that allow for the specific and targeted activation of neurons. The meeting focused on a paper that involved the ability 
    to create false memories in mice using this optogenetics approach. Following the presentation, the group discussed various topics surrounding this emerging field of research, 
    which included use in humans, future applications and limitations of this technology, and possible ethical questions that may be raised when evaluating this tool.

Our third SynBio Club event took place on August 15th and was focused on the use of synthetic biology to create a live virus. As well, this SynBio debated the ethics and morals involved with using synthetic biology, and our responsibilities as scientists to communicate our research. This presentation focused on a paper that was able to use techniques, that we commonly use through QGEM, to synthesize a live and infectious horsepox virus using elements of modern vaccinia virus. The researchers in the paper divided the DNA into ten fragments with overlapping segments, and then ligated the sequences together. They activated the virus by using cells that were already infected with Shobe Fibroma virus (SFV), creating the necessary environment that was capable of assembling the virus fragments together. The research paper noted that this strain could be used as a vaccine against smallpox in humans. It showed less virulence and harmful effects in mice, with also providing vaccine protection. Following the presentation on the paper, the group discussed whether this was a safety concern for the public, the dangers behind the ability to create a live virus, and the accessibility of DNA for synthetic biology practices.

RDFZ-China,Public Engagement,Club activity,"We organized a club dedicated to iGEM in our home school, The High School Affiliated To The Renmin University, called the Genehack Club, and it soon became the base for our public activities. Many team members were selected from this club, and we give lectures that taught various basic knowledge of life sciences. Besides, we launched a series of meetings in which our members shared their knowledge of forefront topics related to iGEM competition with other students in RDFZ, not necessarily restricted to our club members."
RDFZ-China,Public Engagement,Forum of community development,"Public engagement should not stop at school. Beyond this arena, on 21st June, we co-organized a forum of Biology Olympians and high school iGEMers from all over China, and discussed ways to promote the development of Chinese high school biology communities. We reached several conclusions:(1) Current development of high school biology communities often suffer from a lack of resources and attractions, and a “club and competition” model such as Genehack is probably a good attempt to alleviate this problem.(2) A single campus is inevitably limited in human resources and capital-intensive establishments. Therefore communities, even if spatially and temporally seperated, should actively seek to help each other to promote the development of all of them."
RDFZ-China,Public Engagement,Forum of biosafety,"Biosafety is our project’s foremost theme. To better understand the current situation, we participated in a forum of biosafety on 4th October. We obtained a few important informations from Peking and Tsinghua iGEMers. We found that we are now in a very precarious situation, and the Internet poses new problems for monitoring the sale and distribution of biological products that are still not well solved, and DIYbio is rapidly developing with a considerable population base in China that creates novel safety and security concerns. But much progress was made in the field of college laboratory safety and regulations went from nonexistent to systematized with classes, test and zonation in lab. Yet Chinese universities still have a long way to go compared with top-level US colleges."
RDFZ-China,Public Engagement,After iGEM,"As our experiments progressed, we took significant consideration in biosafety, one of the major global issues related to synthetic biology. According to the interview with Jianwen Ye, Chief Engineer of Bluepha, we realized that bacterial strain leakage from fermenter was merely a tip of the iceberg, and kill switch was one of the various anti-leakage systems. Therefore, our journey does not end with Giant Jamboree. We will continue to adjust our kill switch in response to the current demands in medical or industrial fields. Furthermore, from those social researches mentioned above, it is revealed that not only do civilians possess inadequate awareness of biosafety, but some of the doctors and nurses in local clinics also lack of understanding of biosafety. So, we decide to popularize biosafety-related knowledge in the future time, targeting upon a great variety of audience, ranging from schools to communities and eventually to the society."
Rice,Education & Engagement,iGEM in the Community,"

 Over the summer, our team presented to local high schools in the greater Houston area, discussing our project and the iGEM competition overall. We also shared tips on college applications, majoring in STEM, and getting started in STEM research in general.  Among our larger presentations were the presentations to: the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Rice, the Bioethics Debate program at Rice, and students in the School of Science and Technology (SST)."
Ruia-Mumbai,Integated human practices,HUMAN PRACTICES,Our First Approach :
Ruia-Mumbai,Integated human practices, Paan vendors,"
           We interacted with many paan vendors from different areas across Mumbai right from road side paan vendors to well-established paan shop owners. 
            
Why did we approach them?
           Since, there is not much published data about composition of paan preparation, ingredients responsible for paan stain colour, we approached paan vendors to get some first hand information about paan preparation.

            
What we learn?
            We confirmed that the two main ingredients responsible for intense red brown colour of paan are catechu and slaked lime. Based on the collective common answer from all, We got a rough idea of the relative proportions of these two ingredients used for preparing paan. From this interaction, we also learned that very little amount of chunna (slaked lime) is used for making paan.  

 
            


"
Ruia-Mumbai,Integated human practices,"Station master
","We interviewed a Mumbai local Railway Station master Mr. Ganesh Swine at Sion station. Sion station is one of the locations where this issue of paan stains is very much prevalent.
         

            
Why did we approach them?
            This interview was important for us to understand how Railway government approaches the issue of paan stains and the problems they are facing as they tackle these stubborn stains.

            
What did we learn?
            Random spitting of paan is a major problem in Sion station as it is in proximity to a slum area where lack of awareness is huge. Many NGOs have tried to spread awareness by carrying out anti-spitting drives, wall paintings but there has been limited success. For cleaning and maintenance purpose, few small stations like Sion hire 4-5 cleaners while on the other hand some big and crowded stations give contracts to private cleaning agencies.
Approximately 10 liters of acid is used per month to clean the stubborn paan stains in Sion station itself.



            
"
Ruia-Mumbai,Integated human practices,Deputy Commissioner - Government Officials,"
            We interviewed Mr.Kiran Acharekar, Deputy Municipal Commissioner of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) of zone 4.
            
Why did we approach them?
            The main focus of interview was to perceive information about the various impacts of paan stains on government, how they tackles this problem and what different actions were taken by them to lessen paan spitting. Whether BMC would be interested to use different product which is more efficient.
            
What did we learn?
            We realised that the paan spitting problem is increasing day-by-day and it’s getting unmanageable for the government to handle. 
            Special drives of anti-spitting has been carried out, BMC hires marshals who catch hold the person spitting paan in public places and fines them. But in the city of mumbai where the population is more than a crore hiring the relative number of marshals is not affordable or rather impractical,therefore in some selective crowded places only marshals are employed.
            Using an efficient product for cleaning paan stains is always welcomed but most importantly the product should be cost effective.

Ruia-Mumbai,Integated human practices,Cleaning Agencies - Krystal Integrated Services,"
            We interacted with the the Vice President Mr. Rahul Kamble, Vice President - Sales Mr. Milind Jadhav, Head of Training department Miss. Aasawari Vadkar of a well-known cleaning agency in Mumbai - Krystals Integrated Services Pvt. Ltd. The discussions with these experienced managers gave us valuable information about the issue of paan stains.

            
Why did we approach them?
            To understand the deeply rooted problem of paan stains, it was necessary to not only interact with the cleaners who clean these stains but also with the cleaning agencies which hire them. We wished to know the problems encountered during the planning, management and execution of the strategies of dealing with the paan stains.
            
What did we learn?
            We learned that Cleaning paan stains is a major challenge largely unaddressed in the housekeeping industry. It is one of the most difficult part of the cleaning regimen. The paan stains are harder to remove as the time passes due to the drying of the stains. Moreover, the nature of surfaces where paan stains are present play an important factor in deciding the cleaning regimen. 
            
            The newspaper articles and the cleaners state that acid is generally used for cleaning of paan stains. However, it is not acid but acid based chemicals which are commonly employed for cleaning purposes.

Ruia-Mumbai,Integated human practices,Cleaners,"We interviewed the housekeeping staff of a private cleaning agency in Mumbai. This interaction with the cleaners enabled us to understand the reality and gravity of the problem.



           
            
Why did we approach them?
            We were keen to know the practical problems faced by the cleaners who clean these filthy paan stains for their livelihood. Hence, we interviewed the housekeeping staff deployed at one of the business complexes in Mumbai where the paan stains are abundant. 



.             
What did we learn?
            We found that the paan stains are found in all possible places right from the corners, floor and corridors to the dustbins, metal surfaces. The vicious cycle of paan stain and its cleaning is very difficult to break as the paan spitting is deep rooted in the attitude of some people. 

The workers have to scrub vigorously for an average 10-15 minutes to clean a single paan stain covering 10cm*10cm area. This time increases with the duration for which the stain has been on the surface.

""More catechu less slaked lime""
           All the paan vendors we interviewed, told us that the red colour of paan stain is due to catechu and it gets intensified by slaked lime. This information confirmed and matched with our data obtained from literature survey. Moreover, we found out that while preparing paan very less amount of slaked lime is used, as more amount of slaked lime increases alkalinity which may cause burns in mouth.
            
            In order to check the degradation of paan stains by our catechewing coli it was essential for us to know the actual components and their approximate ratio in the paan that gives maximum red-brown colour.
We conducted several experiments for preparation of catechu extract using different ratios of catechu and slaked lime. We observed maximum red colour formation in 10:1 ratio of catechu to slaked lime confirming the information provided.

“Why to concentrate on multiple component?”Focus on degrading the naturally occuring substrate
                     Dr. Ravindra Phadke is an emeritus faculty of Department of Microbiology, Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College,Mumbai. He has done his PhD from Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT),Mumbai in 1995. He loves teaching biochemistry and has unique methods of instilling inquisitiveness amongst students.
  When we were struggling with quantification of paan stain colour due to lack of trusted information about multiple components of catechu, Dr. Phadke came to our rescue. Catechu and slaked lime stock  is a mixture of numerous components. When we determined the wavelength of maximum absorption of this stock, it was found to be 354 nm. This indicated that the major component is a colourless compound absorbing in UV range which was later found to be catechol. So, to determine the component which gives colour to the stain and determine its wavelength of maximum absorption was a challenge. Lack of scientific literature on paan stains further provided resistance to find solution to this challenge. we were reluctant to use LC-MS or HPLC due to lack of funds.
When we consulted Dr.Phadke about this issue, he suggested to focus on catechu extract as a substrate for colour quantification instead of finding its coloured component.

“We desire a liquid formulation, green certified chemical product will surely add cherry on the cake”

        Krystal Cleaning agency is a leading cleaning agency in India. We had a fruitful meeting with the managing committee of Krystal agency Head of Training department Miss. Aasawari Vadkar who gave us valuable feedback about our project . When asked about the desirable nature of product, Sales Manager of the Company advised us to make the paan stain cleaning agent in liquid form as it becomes easy to volumetrically dilute and distribute it in small quantities among the janitors. This advice helped us in eliminating the thought of making our product in solid or spray form.

Moreover, we also found that housekeeping Industry is majorly a manpower based industry wherein the chemicals and cleaning agents constitute a meagre 2-3% of the budget which suggested  that it is of immense importance to price our cleaning agent appropriately.

Cleaning agencies are pushed by the Government to use green certified chemicals. Green certified chemicals are non-toxic, biodegradable and do not contain any volatile components and meets the standard of environmental responsibility. Currently used chemicals produce toxic smell while cleaning which becomes not only an irritant but also are harmful for the cleaners. This inspired us to have our product. 

Thus, we learned about the present methods and recent developments in cleaning paan stains from this interaction with Krystal Integrated Services. The managers of Krystal Integrated Services encouraged us to take plunge into solving the problem of paan stains.

“Is your product versatile? Does autoclaving affects catechu”
            Ajay Bio-tech suggested that instead of a product that degrades only paan stains, industry would want something that is more versatile. They suggested that we incorporate multiple enzymes in our formulation to enhance the versatility. To check the versatility of product first we tried to test it on common laboratory dye safranin. We got a positive degradation result for safranin. We got a positive degradation result for congo red dye,safranin.
For more details refer to our result section.
They also had an interesting question which was whether we autoclave the catechu extract before incorporating it into the media. In practical autoclaving affects the stability of some compounds that may affects the reaction with enzymes and the colour intensity of compound. We thought on this question and checked the stability of catechu before and after autoclave. 
For more details see protocols - Effects of autoclaving on catechu.
"
Ruia-Mumbai,Integated human practices,Novozymes,"
""Focus on enzyme andWhy don’t try GRAS?""

Skype meeting with novozymes bestowed us some key suggestions which are totally worth incorporating in our project for it to be a successful product.
Our chassis for expression of paan stain degrading genes is Escherichia coli. E.coli is a LPS (lipopolysaccharide producer) and an intestinal flora. Hence, industries like novozymes do not suggest using it as a chassis for enzyme production. Instead, GRAS (generally recognized as safe) organisms like yeast, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus sp, Trichoderma sp. are used as chassis for industrial production of enzymes.


This is an incredibly valuable suggestion for the future of the project. We were especially delighted because A. niger was one of the isolates we found to be degrading paan stains. However, for the purpose of iGEM we continued to use E. coli as a chassis.



Novozymes also directed us to focus on the right enzyme and ensure that the breakdown products of paan stain do not attract more dirt.

They strongly advised us to purify paan stain degrading enzymes and use it for industrial applications instead of the Genetically modified organism (GMO).
They also suggested that they prefer enzymes in their natural forms i.e without any tags. For the purpose of iGEM we have used enzymes with tags such as histag but in the future we desire to incorporate this suggestion by Novozymes.

They were of the opinion that our product would have a great market in the housekeeping and detergent industry.

            Street play is a key tool in generating awareness effectively in a shorter span of time. It was a  wholesome experience for our team to step out of the lab and engage with the society through the street play. For a street play to become successful, it is essential to give a power-packed crowd-engaging performance. Under the guidance and direction of veteran actress Mrs. Sushma Rege, we tried to put our best foot forward in exploring this art arena. Rege Ma’am helped us to effectively deliver a regional dialect and how to modulate our voice throughout the play. She also helped us to improve the overall impact of street play making it a success.

Ruia-Mumbai,Integated human practices,Social media challenge,"#PaanSePareshaan
                  Social media is a powerful tool to engage primarily with current youth.We decided to use trending social media challenges as our approach to spread awareness about this paan stains menace. We announced our social media challenge #PaanSePareshaan (annoyed of paan stains) to highlight the huge impact of spitting haphazardly, wherein the one who accepts the challenge needs to click a photo pointing at disgusting paan stains and post it as a story/post with location on social media handles like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter and tag iGEM Ruia-Mumbai, add location of the place along with #PaanSePareshaan.
The focus of the challenge was to make people realize the omnipresence of nasty paan stains.


We got a positive response to the challenge from youngsters as well as elder citizens. The challenge was a learning experience for our team as we came to know the range of places where paan spits are found and the mentality of people spitting paan. For instance spitting in dustbins, on railway tracks, in corners, over potted plants, on walls that mentions DO NOT SPIT is considered as a normal practice.   
  
                   The challenge initiated critical discussion and debate among people resulting in an increased realization of the existence of this problem. (screenshot of the post). The #PaanSePareshaan challenge is still ongoing and we are trying to spread it as much as possible to create awareness on a larger scale.

                       Our another approach to engage with local public and create awareness was a street play. Street play is an effective way of engaging people and educating them about a social problem. In a fast paced city like Mumbai, people seldom take out time for a social cause. Moreover, retaining common public’s attention span is also a task. Ganesh festival is celebrated on a large scale in India, particularly Mumbai. During this period, Lord Ganesha’s idol is worshipped and people come together to celebrate this festival. We interacted with this gathering of people/devotees, conducted fun games relevant to our project and performed the skit in Ganesh pandal of Mulund. We performed a street play focusing on issue of paan stains and highlighted key points like why people should not spit randomly?, How much amount of money is invested in cleaning these stains. Our major focus area was amount of water in liters required to clean paan stains. Moreover to gain attention of crowd, humorous content was included and the skit was conducted in an entertaining way..The skit was performed in the regional Marathi language with an added slice of humour so as to reach a wider audience in an entertaining yet enlightening way.

Ruia-Mumbai,Engagement, Paan vendors,"
           We interacted with many paan vendors from different areas across Mumbai right from road side paan vendors to well-established paan shop owners. 
            
Why did we approach them?
           Since, there is not much published data about composition of paan preparation, ingredients responsible for paan stain colour, we approached paan vendors to get some first hand information about paan preparation.

            
What we learn?
            We confirmed that the two main ingredients responsible for intense red brown colour of paan are catechu and slaked lime. Based on the collective common answer from all, We got a rough idea of the relative proportions of these two ingredients used for preparing paan. From this interaction, we also learned that very little amount of chunna (slaked lime) is used for making paan.

","We interviewed a Mumbai local Railway Station master Mr. Ganesh Swine at Sion station. Sion station is one of the locations where this issue of paan stains is very much prevalent.
         

            
Why did we approach them?
            This interview was important for us to understand how Railway government approaches the issue of paan stains and the problems they are facing as they tackle these stubborn stains.

            
What did we learn?
            Random spitting of paan is a major problem in Sion station as it is in proximity to a slum area where lack of awareness is huge. Many NGOs have tried to spread awareness by carrying out anti-spitting drives, wall paintings but there has been limited success. For cleaning and maintenance purpose, few small stations like Sion hire 4-5 cleaners while on the other hand some big and crowded stations give contracts to private cleaning agencies.
Approximately 10 liters of acid is used per month to clean the stubborn paan stains in Sion station itself.

Why did we approach them?
            The main focus of interview was to perceive information about the various impacts of paan stains on government, how they tackles this problem and what different actions were taken by them to lessen paan spitting. Whether BMC would be interested to use different product which is more efficient.
            
What did we learn?
            We realised that the paan spitting problem is increasing day-by-day and it’s getting unmanageable for the government to handle. 
            Special drives of anti-spitting has been carried out, BMC hires marshals who catch hold the person spitting paan in public places and fines them. But in the city of mumbai where the population is more than a crore hiring the relative number of marshals is not affordable or rather impractical,therefore in some selective crowded places only marshals are employed.
            Using an efficient product for cleaning paan stains is always welcomed but most importantly the product should be cost effective.

Aasawari Vadkar of a well-known cleaning agency in Mumbai - Krystals Integrated Services Pvt. Ltd. The discussions with these experienced managers gave us valuable information about the issue of paan stains.

            
Why did we approach them?
            To understand the deeply rooted problem of paan stains, it was necessary to not only interact with the cleaners who clean these stains but also with the cleaning agencies which hire them. We wished to know the problems encountered during the planning, management and execution of the strategies of dealing with the paan stains.
            
What did we learn?
            We learned that Cleaning paan stains is a major challenge largely unaddressed in the housekeeping industry. It is one of the most difficult part of the cleaning regimen. The paan stains are harder to remove as the time passes due to the drying of the stains. Moreover, the nature of surfaces where paan stains are present play an important factor in deciding the cleaning regimen. 
            
            The newspaper articles and the cleaners state that acid is generally used for cleaning of paan stains. However, it is not acid but acid based chemicals which are commonly employed for cleaning purposes.

            We were keen to know the practical problems faced by the cleaners who clean these filthy paan stains for their livelihood. Hence, we interviewed the housekeeping staff deployed at one of the business complexes in Mumbai where the paan stains are abundant. 



.             
What did we learn?
            We found that the paan stains are found in all possible places right from the corners, floor and corridors to the dustbins, metal surfaces. The vicious cycle of paan stain and its cleaning is very difficult to break as the paan spitting is deep rooted in the attitude of some people. 

The workers have to scrub vigorously for an average 10-15 minutes to clean a single paan stain covering 10cm*10cm area. This time increases with the duration for which the stain has been on the surface.

""More catechu less slaked lime""
           All the paan vendors we interviewed, told us that the red colour of paan stain is due to catechu and it gets intensified by slaked lime. This information confirmed and matched with our data obtained from literature survey. Moreover, we found out that while preparing paan very less amount of slaked lime is used, as more amount of slaked lime increases alkalinity which may cause burns in mouth.
            
            In order to check the degradation of paan stains by our catechewing coli it was essential for us to know the actual components and their approximate ratio in the paan that gives maximum red-brown colour.
We conducted several experiments for preparation of catechu extract using different ratios of catechu and slaked lime. We observed maximum red colour formation in 10:1 ratio of catechu to slaked lime confirming the information provided.

“Why to concentrate on multiple component?”Focus on degrading the naturally occuring substrate
                     Dr. Ravindra Phadke is an emeritus faculty of Department of Microbiology, Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College,Mumbai. He has done his PhD from Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT),Mumbai in 1995. He loves teaching biochemistry and has unique methods of instilling inquisitiveness amongst students.
  When we were struggling with quantification of paan stain colour due to lack of trusted information about multiple components of catechu, Dr. Phadke came to our rescue. Catechu and slaked lime stock  is a mixture of numerous components. When we determined the wavelength of maximum absorption of this stock, it was found to be 354 nm. This indicated that the major component is a colourless compound absorbing in UV range which was later found to be catechol. So, to determine the component which gives colour to the stain and determine its wavelength of maximum absorption was a challenge. Lack of scientific literature on paan stains further provided resistance to find solution to this challenge. we were reluctant to use LC-MS or HPLC due to lack of funds.
When we consulted Dr.Phadke about this issue, he suggested to focus on catechu extract as a substrate for colour quantification instead of finding its coloured component.

“We desire a liquid formulation, green certified chemical product will surely add cherry on the cake”

        Krystal Cleaning agency is a leading cleaning agency in India. We had a fruitful meeting with the managing committee of Krystal agency Head of Training department Miss. Aasawari Vadkar who gave us valuable feedback about our project . When asked about the desirable nature of product, Sales Manager of the Company advised us to make the paan stain cleaning agent in liquid form as it becomes easy to volumetrically dilute and distribute it in small quantities among the janitors. This advice helped us in eliminating the thought of making our product in solid or spray form.

Moreover, we also found that housekeeping Industry is majorly a manpower based industry wherein the chemicals and cleaning agents constitute a meagre 2-3% of the budget which suggested  that it is of immense importance to price our cleaning agent appropriately.

Cleaning agencies are pushed by the Government to use green certified chemicals. Green certified chemicals are non-toxic, biodegradable and do not contain any volatile components and meets the standard of environmental responsibility. Currently used chemicals produce toxic smell while cleaning which becomes not only an irritant but also are harmful for the cleaners. This inspired us to have our product. 

Thus, we learned about the present methods and recent developments in cleaning paan stains from this interaction with Krystal Integrated Services. The managers of Krystal Integrated Services encouraged us to take plunge into solving the problem of paan stains.

“Is your product versatile? Does autoclaving affects catechu”
            Ajay Bio-tech suggested that instead of a product that degrades only paan stains, industry would want something that is more versatile. They suggested that we incorporate multiple enzymes in our formulation to enhance the versatility. To check the versatility of product first we tried to test it on common laboratory dye safranin. We got a positive degradation result for safranin. We got a positive degradation result for congo red dye,safranin.
For more details refer to our result section.
They also had an interesting question which was whether we autoclave the catechu extract before incorporating it into the media. In practical autoclaving affects the stability of some compounds that may affects the reaction with enzymes and the colour intensity of compound. We thought on this question and checked the stability of catechu before and after autoclave. 
For more details see protocols - Effects of autoclaving on catechu.

Ruia-Mumbai,Engagement,Novozymes,"
""Focus on enzyme andWhy don’t try GRAS?""

Skype meeting with novozymes bestowed us some key suggestions which are totally worth incorporating in our project for it to be a successful product.
Our chassis for expression of paan stain degrading genes is Escherichia coli. E.coli is a LPS (lipopolysaccharide producer) and an intestinal flora. Hence, industries like novozymes do not suggest using it as a chassis for enzyme production. Instead, GRAS (generally recognized as safe) organisms like yeast, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus sp, Trichoderma sp. are used as chassis for industrial production of enzymes.


This is an incredibly valuable suggestion for the future of the project. We were especially delighted because A. niger was one of the isolates we found to be degrading paan stains. However, for the purpose of iGEM we continued to use E. coli as a chassis.



Novozymes also directed us to focus on the right enzyme and ensure that the breakdown products of paan stain do not attract more dirt.

They strongly advised us to purify paan stain degrading enzymes and use it for industrial applications instead of the Genetically modified organism (GMO).
They also suggested that they prefer enzymes in their natural forms i.e without any tags. For the purpose of iGEM we have used enzymes with tags such as histag but in the future we desire to incorporate this suggestion by Novozymes.

They were of the opinion that our product would have a great market in the housekeeping and detergent industry.

                  Social media is a powerful tool to engage primarily with current youth.We decided to use trending social media challenges as our approach to spread awareness about this paan stains menace. We announced our social media challenge #PaanSePareshaan (annoyed of paan stains) to highlight the huge impact of spitting haphazardly, wherein the one who accepts the challenge needs to click a photo pointing at disgusting paan stains and post it as a story/post with location on social media handles like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter and tag iGEM Ruia-Mumbai, add location of the place along with #PaanSePareshaan.
The focus of the challenge was to make people realize the omnipresence of nasty paan stains.


We got a positive response to the challenge from youngsters as well as elder citizens. The challenge was a learning experience for our team as we came to know the range of places where paan spits are found and the mentality of people spitting paan. For instance spitting in dustbins, on railway tracks, in corners, over potted plants, on walls that mentions DO NOT SPIT is considered as a normal practice.   
  
                   The challenge initiated critical discussion and debate among people resulting in an increased realization of the existence of this problem. (screenshot of the post). The #PaanSePareshaan challenge is still ongoing and we are trying to spread it as much as possible to create awareness on a larger scale.

Moreover, retaining common public’s attention span is also a task. Ganesh festival is celebrated on a large scale in India, particularly Mumbai. During this period, Lord Ganesha’s idol is worshipped and people come together to celebrate this festival. We interacted with this gathering of people/devotees, conducted fun games relevant to our project and performed the skit in Ganesh pandal of Mulund. We performed a street play focusing on issue of paan stains and highlighted key points like why people should not spit randomly?, How much amount of money is invested in cleaning these stains. Our major focus area was amount of water in liters required to clean paan stains. Moreover to gain attention of crowd, humorous content was included and the skit was conducted in an entertaining way..The skit was performed in the regional Marathi language with an added slice of humour so as to reach a wider audience in an entertaining yet enlightening way.

For more details refer to our result section.
They also had an interesting question which was whether we autoclave the catechu extract before incorporating it into the media. In practical autoclaving affects the stability of some compounds that may affects the reaction with enzymes and the colour intensity of compound. We thought on this question and checked the stability of catechu before and after autoclave. 
For more details see protocols - Effects of autoclaving on catechu.

""Focus on enzyme andWhy don’t try GRAS?""

Skype meeting with novozymes bestowed us some key suggestions which are totally worth incorporating in our project for it to be a successful product.
Our chassis for expression of paan stain degrading genes is Escherichia coli. E.coli is a LPS (lipopolysaccharide producer) and an intestinal flora. Hence, industries like novozymes do not suggest using it as a chassis for enzyme production. Instead, GRAS (generally recognized as safe) organisms like yeast, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus sp, Trichoderma sp. are used as chassis for industrial production of enzymes.


This is an incredibly valuable suggestion for the future of the project. We were especially delighted because A. niger was one of the isolates we found to be degrading paan stains. However, for the purpose of iGEM we continued to use E. coli as a chassis.



Novozymes also directed us to focus on the right enzyme and ensure that the breakdown products of paan stain do not attract more dirt.

They strongly advised us to purify paan stain degrading enzymes and use it for industrial applications instead of the Genetically modified organism (GMO).
They also suggested that they prefer enzymes in their natural forms i.e without any tags. For the purpose of iGEM we have used enzymes with tags such as histag but in the future we desire to incorporate this suggestion by Novozymes.

They were of the opinion that our product would have a great market in the housekeeping and detergent industry.

""Smartly decide the time to start social media challenge""


            To make common people realize and spread awareness about the depth of this social problem we decided to start with a social media challenge. Our main concern here was how to maximize the reach of challenge and reach out to the policy makers. We seeked guidance from Miss Nidhi Kamdar, Officer on Special Duty at Chief Minister of Maharashtra office. We got several tips on extending the reach of our challenge. Some key points include:-

“A street play should be crowd pulling”



            Street play is a key tool in generating awareness effectively in a shorter span of time. It was a  wholesome experience for our team to step out of the lab and engage with the society through the street play. For a street play to become successful, it is essential to give a power-packed crowd-engaging performance. Under the guidance and direction of veteran actress Mrs. Sushma Rege, we tried to put our best foot forward in exploring this art arena. Rege Ma’am helped us to effectively deliver a regional dialect and how to modulate our voice throughout the play. She also helped us to improve the overall impact of street play making it a success.

              Microbiology department of Ramnarain Ruia college comprises of in all 4 UG batches which have on an average 40 students per batch performing practicals on 6 week days.
If on an average every student requires 5 glasswares of each type listed below, then the total requirement of each type of glassware is as follows:
40 students *4 batches = 160 students
160 students*5 glasswares of each type* 6 days = 4800 glasswares
Hence, we need a total of 4800 glasswares of each type.



                Let us go through the number of each type of glassware we have for UG students in our department

Ruia-Mumbai,HUMAN PRACTICES,Social media challenge,"#PaanSePareshaan
                  Social media is a powerful tool to engage primarily with current youth.We decided to use trending social media challenges as our approach to spread awareness about this paan stains menace. We announced our social media challenge #PaanSePareshaan (annoyed of paan stains) to highlight the huge impact of spitting haphazardly, wherein the one who accepts the challenge needs to click a photo pointing at disgusting paan stains and post it as a story/post with location on social media handles like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter and tag iGEM Ruia-Mumbai, add location of the place along with #PaanSePareshaan.
The focus of the challenge was to make people realize the omnipresence of nasty paan stains.


We got a positive response to the challenge from youngsters as well as elder citizens. The challenge was a learning experience for our team as we came to know the range of places where paan spits are found and the mentality of people spitting paan. For instance spitting in dustbins, on railway tracks, in corners, over potted plants, on walls that mentions DO NOT SPIT is considered as a normal practice.   
  
                   The challenge initiated critical discussion and debate among people resulting in an increased realization of the existence of this problem. (screenshot of the post). The #PaanSePareshaan challenge is still ongoing and we are trying to spread it as much as possible to create awareness on a larger scale.

                       Our another approach to engage with local public and create awareness was a street play. Street play is an effective way of engaging people and educating them about a social problem. In a fast paced city like Mumbai, people seldom take out time for a social cause. Moreover, retaining common public’s attention span is also a task. Ganesh festival is celebrated on a large scale in India, particularly Mumbai. During this period, Lord Ganesha’s idol is worshipped and people come together to celebrate this festival. We interacted with this gathering of people/devotees, conducted fun games relevant to our project and performed the skit in Ganesh pandal of Mulund. We performed a street play focusing on issue of paan stains and highlighted key points like why people should not spit randomly?, How much amount of money is invested in cleaning these stains. Our major focus area was amount of water in liters required to clean paan stains. Moreover to gain attention of crowd, humorous content was included and the skit was conducted in an entertaining way..The skit was performed in the regional Marathi language with an added slice of humour so as to reach a wider audience in an entertaining yet enlightening way.

Not only the applicability of the ideas was considered but also its feasibility and implications.The ideas foddered our minds and developed our critical, analytical and creative abilities. Our juniors got themselves familiarized with the emerging and exciting field of synthetic biology.                  
                   

"
SZU-China,Education & Public engagement,Introduction,"
							This year, we developed an application, Biocampany, a software that is installed on the chat software WeChat (a software used by almost everyone in China). Our applet integrates the advantages of WeChat. So, you don’t need to download another app. While using our software, you can also chat with friends, play mini games and so on. It is a new-concept and convenient software that can be used regardless of the system’s mobile phone. Besides, promoting a new application needs lots of work while WeChat is already a systematic and successful software. That’s why we put our application on WeChat platform instead of making an individual application.

						"
SZU-China,Education & Public engagement,For education and public engagement:,"
							It’s a corridor and for the public to contact iGEM and synthetic biology.
						
							For iGEM and synthetic biology education, we uploaded the post about knowledge of synthetic biology and information about iGEM regularly. People can gradually have a comprehensive understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology.

						
							For iGEM teams, iGEM teams can post their projects to our applet. People can subscribe the projects that they are interested in and give the teams suggestions in comment section to improve or modify the projects.

						
							It’s also a tool that make people participate in the iGEM project directly. People can send the sample for the project or iGEM teams can distribute some models to the public and ask them for help. If you are really interested in the project, you can even give the project a little bonus to support them or pay a visit to their lab.
						Meanwhile, we did more education and public engagement work with our application.(click here to see detail)"
SZU-China,Education & Public engagement,Background,"
							Our PI recommended our applet to some teachers and friends. A teacher from Yueliangwan Primary School 
							subscribed our project and called us that because synthetic biology belongs to a new concept with great potential, he wanted to invite us to their primary school to give a popularization about cockroaches and synthetic biology, so that the students can contact with the new concept as soon as possible.

						"
SZU-China,Education & Public engagement,Procedure,"
							We customized 100 boxes according to the number of local residents, and then came to the village of Chenzhou City, Hunan Province with boxes and related supplies.
						
							In the afternoon, we distributed all the boxes to the villagers, and instructed them on how to use and emphasized some things that should be paid attention to when using them. Then we told them that we would have a return visit in two days. They can tell us their feel and suggest some improvements to our box after using.

						"
SZU-China,Education & Public engagement,Feedback:,"
							1. When they tried making our parts of Green Ground together, they did not know how to finish it, which showed that the box we designed was not reasonable enough and did need improvement.

						
							2. When we were giving a popularization about synthetic biology, the primary school students didn’t have a clear understanding, even though we used a comic book. We had a conclusion that we need to not only give a popularization more logically, but also use some examples that close to them to help them associate synthetic biology with their daily lives.

						After this education, we found two problems including our project itself and ways of science popularization. Receiving their feedbacks, we redesigned our model to make it easier to build. In addition, we are considering using a more logical and comprehensive way to give a talk with the examples of our daily lives."
SZU-China,Education & Public engagement,Background:,"
							After we designed our model, we hoped our product can contribute to society, so we uploaded a post about distributing our product with wild spores to someone in need. After several days, we received some information and decided the destination, Hunan. A villager as well as a schoolmate of Shenzhen University from Hunan provided their village for us to test our product and we helped them kill cockroaches with the product.
						"
SZU-China,Education & Public engagement,Feedback,"
							On the third day, during the return visit, the villagers said that the box was very useful, but felt that the box was not very convenient to use, and it was not easy to operate when disassembling the dressing. The advice they gave us was to change the original height of the magnet to a screw-and-twist control, which is easier to operate and more robust. At the same time, they felt that only two ramps restricted the entry of the cymbal and should be changed to a circular shape. The base, so that 360 ° is a ramp, more convenient to enter.

						
							After receiving their suggestions, we designed it again and uploaded it to application for more suggestions.

						"
SZU-China,Education & Public engagement,"
						Conclusion
					","
							With applet, we can do more education and public engagement like Yueliangwan Primary School Education and Public Engagement in Hunan Province. Moreover, we can post more articles about iGEM and synthetic biology from our applet that offers a broader platform for the public to get close to us and join us.

TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Integrated Human Practices,"From the beginning, the Human Practices took a central role in shaping our project. When we started our brainstorm sessions in March, we had no clue which topic we wanted to explore. Yet, we wanted it to be relevant to society. During these first months, we got the opportunity to interact with experts and the public to discuss our ideas. These encounters were of great help in our topic selection. During a visit to the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Instituut (Dutch organization for technology assessment), we realized that the lack of a safe platform for working with GMOs outside of controlled environments is a problem on itself that deserves a solution. We were excited to tackle this issue with Gelcatraz, but also wanted to work towards a more concrete application. In the time that followed, we consulted several experts and interacted with the public to get feedback on our proposals. Once we had settled on the wound healing application, we interacted with more stakeholders and experts to shape the design of the wound healing patch. We also performed a stakeholder-value analysis  and an ethical analysis  of our design, and we considered safety during all stages of the project for safe-by-design. We realize that our project would not have been the same without the Human Practices.In the following section, we share the insights we gained from interactions with stakeholders and experts during the three main stages of the project: finding a project, finding an application and shaping the design. Here you can explore our journey of integrated human practices."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,I. Finding a project,"Thanks to the TU/e Contest and various brainstorm sessions, we had settled on the living material project. Although we decided to focus on the adhesin system, we wanted to demonstrate the potential of our platform by applying it to a social problem. To find the ‘perfect’ application, we consulted various experts, interacted with the public and attended a biotech conference. We also reflected on the ethical consequences of our potential applications before settling on wound infections."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,February & March ,"Initially, we considered a wide range of topics, from glucose sensors to
                        solar energy, and from ocean clean-ups to artificial organs. The number
                        of options seemed unlimited, and our search was scattered. As a source of
                        inspiration, we consulted newspaper articles, checked the wiki pages of
                        previous iGEM teams and talked to several professors at our university.
                        When going through the wiki pages of previous teams, we realized that
                        many of them  struggled with the use of their creations outside of the
                        laboratory. We also came across an article by Liu et al. (2017), who
                        attempted to design a ‘living material’ by means of several layers used
                        to entrap bacteria. Inspired by this cool work, we decided we wanted to
                        do something similar in order to facilitate the easy use of GMOs.
                        However, instead of using several layers for entrapment, we wanted to
                        equip our bacteria with their own anchor. After several brainstorm
                        meetings, we settled on this challenging subject as the goal of our
                        2018 iGEM project!

TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,April & May - TU/e contest,"Right after we decided to anchor bacteria to a hydrogel, we decided to register for the TU/e Contest . This is an annual ideation contest organized by our university, in which students are encouraged to develop their innovative ideas into start-ups. The contest was intended for students who already had a clear idea that they wanted to bring to the market. Unfortunately, our project was still quite vague (‘adhering bacteria to a hydrogel’). Nevertheless, our participation was still useful. We got to meet companies, participate in workshops and pitch our project to the public. Along the way, we received quite some feedback from the participating companies."

TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,II. Finding an application,"Thanks to the TU/e Contest and various brainstorm sessions, we had settled on the living material project. Although we decided to focus on the adhesin system, we wanted to demonstrate the potential of our platform by applying it to a social problem. To find the ‘perfect’ application, we consulted various experts, interacted with the public and attended a biotech conference. We also reflected on the ethical consequences of our potential applications before settling on wound infections."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"May 14, 2018. Dutch iGEM meetup RIVM and Rathenau Institute.","In May, we were invited to The Hague for a Dutch iGEM meet-up organized by two public institutes: The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM ) and the Rathenau Institute, an institute for technology assessment. The theme of the meet-up was Human Practices. As we had only just started our Human Practices trajectory, this day was a great way to get inspired."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"May 16, 2018. Meeting Prof. Dr. Patricia Dankers","As we had decided to develop a living material, we wanted to speak to an expert in the field of biomaterials to ask for some feedback on the design and explore possible applications. We therefore contacted professor Patricia Dankers, a professor in biomedical materials for regenerative medicine. We discussed our preliminary selection of dextran as our hydrogel. Prof. Dankers encouraged us to limit ourselves to this gel instead of also exploring other options, as dextran is known to have affinity for glucose and the production of multiple gels would be time-consuming."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,May Brainstorm sessions,"Inspired by the Dutch iGEM meet-up and by our participation in the TU/e Contest  , we were determined to find an application relevant to society. During several brainstorm and literature sessions, we composed a list of possible applications. Inspired by work performed by previous iGEM teams,  the experts we talked to during the Dutch meet-up and by our meeting with professor Dankers, we decided to investigate bacterial sensors (malaria, urea, scabies), kidney failure, water filtration, bone infections, vaccines, eczema and wound infections."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"May 22, 2018. Netherlands Biotechnology Congress","Our first conference! With the other Dutch iGEM teams, we were invited to present a poster at the Netherlands Biotechnology Congress. During the several talks we learned about new developments in biotechnology and public acceptance of GMOs. The highlight of the day was an intriguing talk by Marc Lynas, a British environmental activist and journalist who explained how he moved from violently opposing GMO crops to supporting them. The conference also offered a platform to discuss our project with biotechnologists and with the overgrad winning team of iGEM 2017, TU Delft. After a few drinks and a good meal, we returned home with a lot of new insights."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"June 1, 2018. Meeting with an ethicist: Dr. Lily Frank","To examine the ethical implications of our iGEM project, we contacted Dr. Lily Frank.  She is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Ethics at Eindhoven University of Technology and is specialized in Biomedical Ethics. With Lily we discussed the potential benefits and dangers of synthetic biology, and she pointed us at some of the more controversial issues related to synthetic biology."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"June 9, 2018. Dutch Technology Week","The Dutch Technology Week (DTW) is all about promoting Dutch high-tech to the public. During this week, many high-tech companies open their doors.  It is a good opportunity to raise public awareness about synthetic biology! We arranged a stand during the High-Tech Discovery Route. We made hair gel and slime with kids. While some of us entertained the children, others got the opportunity to discuss our applications with the parents. "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"June 18, 2018. Kick-off Safe-by-Design Challenge: Skype with Korienke Smit and Niek Savelkoul (RIVM)",The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) challenged us to take part in their safe-by-design challenge. This challenge was about integrating safety in different phases of our project.
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"June 22, 2018. Meeting Dr. Sandra Hofmann","Before deciding on an application, we had a final meeting with Sandra Hofmann. She is an assistant professor in mechanobiology in bone tissue engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology. We had found a paper (Johnson et al., 2018) on bone fracture healing with lysostaphin that we wanted to discuss with her, as we considered the secretion of lysostaphin by our living material."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"June 22, 2018. The final decision","We took the feedback received from Sandra Hofmann, during the Dutch Technology Week and earlier feedback from previous iGEM teams and experts into account to settle on the application we would be working on. "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,III. Shaping the design,"Once we had decided to focus on wound healing, there were many new questions to be answered by the Human Practices team. How to offer patients suffering from infected wounds the best possible treatment? Is there indeed a need for a new treatment? What requirements does our material need to fulfill? What are the medical details of the wounds? Which bacteria do we need to kill? To collect answers to these questions and many more, we contacted several experts and stakeholders."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"July 3, 2018. Plasmacure","In our search for existing and future wound treatments, we came across Plasmacure.
                        Plasmacure is a start-up aiming to cure chronic wounds, especially diabetic wounds,
                        with plasma (fourth phase of matter). They developed a small machine producing
                        plasma which can be connected to a disposable plaster. The plaster is applied to
                        the wound. During a one-minute treatment, the wound is exposed to plasma. This
                        should be enough to kill all bacteria and fungi on the wound. This treatment is
                        repeated ten times. The product is still under development, but the first small
                        clinical trial showed positive results for half of the patients.  During a meeting
                        with their CMO Koen Lim, Lim was so kind to sketch the wound market and its
                        problems, to share his solution and to give us feedback on our plans. We also
                        learned about the long and winding trajectory of bringing a medical device to the
                        market. This resulted in our problem sketch."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"July 20-22, 2018. European Meetup Munich","In July, we traveled to Munich for a meet-up organized by iGEM Munich. We had a great time meeting other iGEM teams, exchanging ideas and we received a lot of feedback on our design and potential problems."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"August 01, 2018. Skype call with Lori Goff","Lori develops hydrogel membranes for water filtration. She was so kind to call us to give us feedback on our project. She approved our idea of using our living material in a biomedical context, as she expected the most potential in that area."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"August 03, 2018. Skype with iGEM Düsseldorf: The potential of quorum sensing as a mean to prevent overcrowding and/or infiltration","During the European iGEM meet-up in Munich, we received some useful feedback from team Düsseldorf. They warned us for the potential problem of overcrowding. For their project, they are developing a quorum sensing mechanism to regulate cell density."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"August 07, 2018. Meeting with professor Menno Prins about biosensing",Menno Prins is a professor at TU/e active in the field of molecular biosensing who develops technologies for protein detection and the study of protein function. We met with him to discuss the potential of our living material in sensing applications. He warned us that bacterial biosensors have two serious disadvantages compared to (bio)chemical or physical sensors: they require very stable environments and detection is slow compared to other sensors: on the time scale of hours versus milliseconds.
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"August 10, 2018. Safe-by-design: Phone call with Cécile van der Vlugt","For the Safe-by-design challenge  we had a phone call with Cécile van der Vlugt. She is active in the field of risk assessment and provided us with some interesting feedback on our work done so far. The phone call was very useful to put our work into perspective. For instance, she stressed that although it is good to be cautious, we do not need to see risks everywhere. In the week before the call, we had been researching alternatives to the toxic chemicals we use in the synthesis of our hydrogel gel. She said that in principle there is no need to replace the chemicals, as long as we ensure safe working conditions."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"Augus 13, 2018. Kill switches: Meeting with Prof. dr. Jan van Hest","Inspired by our conversion with Prof. Menno Prins, we decided to take the safety of our device a step further by integrating a kill switch. This would minimize the risk of bacterial escape even further. By making our bacteria dependent on an artificial amino acid and including this in the medium, we could ensure that bacteria which escape the gel die. Through point mutations, one makes essential proteins dependent on an artificial amino acid. To examine this option, we contacted professor Jan van Hest, who has a lot of experience with artificial amino acids."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,July – August 2018 iGEM'ers Guide to the Future – Stakeholder value matrix,"Inspired by the iGEM’ers Guide to the Future, we performed a stakeholder-value matrix. Over the course of July and August, we reflected on the consequences of our design for several stakeholders. The entire analysis can be found here. From the stakeholder-value analysis, it is concluded that Gelcatraz introduces significant benefits to most stakeholders discussed. Importantly, patients will benefit from the plaster as they will experience less pain, enjoy faster wound healing and thus get a better quality of life. The major safety issues have been addressed under safe-by-design. Medical professionals will also appreciate Gelcatraz as a new tool which will facilitate and ease their treatments."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"August 21, 2018. Freshmen’s week @ TU/e ","During the introduction week for new students, we got the opportunity to promote iGEM at a fair. We talked to new students from all kinds of disciplines about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. The students were very curious to hear why we decided to spend our summer in the lab! We also introduced the newbies to our iGEM project and asked them whether they would wear a patch with bacteria on their skin. Interestingly, after sharing some information on the role of the bacteria in our design, they seemed to agree that they would wear the patch if we could ensure the safety of the patch."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"August 27, 2018. Burn wound center Maasstad Ziekenhuis","As several experts  told us that our patch could have potential as a treatment of burn wounds, we wanted to know more about the options and requirements. We contacted Dr. Jan Dokter, specialized in burn wounds at the Maasstad Ziekenhuis. This hospital in Rotterdam hosts one of the three Dutch centers specialized in the treatment of burn wounds. They treat approximately 300 patients annually, who represent 45% of all Dutch patients with severe burn wounds. Dr. Dokter was so kind to invite us over for a visit."

TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"Sept 21, 2018 Visit to PAMM: Foundation for Infective Diseases and Pathology","PAMM is a foundation for Infective Diseases and Pathology. They perform diagnostics for hospitals in the region and are also involved in prevention. We are indeed very lucky to have PAMM as one of our main partners! PAMM is not only helping us financially, but also offered help with the functional testing of lysostaphin."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"Oct 02, 2018 Skype call with medical doctor Dr. Edgar Peters (VUmc Amsterdam) ","To investigate the option of applying our bandage to diabetic wounds, we contacted internist Edgar Peters. Two of his specializations are diabetic feet and infected wounds. Furthermore, he is specialized in infections caused by biomaterials. Perfect for our project!"
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"Oct 03, 2018 Visit to ‘Expertisecentrum wondzorg’ (expertise center wound care)","To get more insight into the treatment of wounds, we are not interested in treatments against infections, but also in general wound treatment. We therefore contacted the Expertise Center for Wound care in Oosterhout. We were invited by Dr. Jacques Neyens for a visit."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"Oct 04, 2018. Plastic surgeon M.D. Lesley Bouwer","As Koen Lim from Plasmacure had told us that plastic surgeons regularly deal with wound infections, we contacted plastic surgeon Lesley Bouwer. Via e-mail, he answered some questions."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,"Oct 05, 2018. Patient Karel",Via Jacques Neyens (Expertisecentrum Wondzorg) we got in touch with patient Karel. He suffers from diabetic wounds which heal poorly. Karel was so kind to explain his situation and answer some questions.
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,What type of wounds do you have?,Diabetic wounds which heal slowly. One of the wounds on my feet got infected. It took six (!) weeks of systemic antibiotics to get rid of it. This had a great impact on my well-being.
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,How are your experiences with continuous wound care?,The pain and discomfort caused by the treatments are limited. Except for the consequences of antibiotic treatments.
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,How much discomfort do your wounds bring you?,"A lot, since my wounds are large. Furthermore, they are pretty deep and cleaning them may make cause them to expand."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,How long have you been suffering from your wounds?,Since February.
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Do your wounds have an impact on your life?,"They have a large impact. I can barely walk due to the wounds on my feet. Heel erg veel. Omdat het wonden op de voet zijn kan er nauwelijks op gelopen worden. In February, dead tissue was removed, causing a big hole. After that, my blood circulation reduced, which has been solved by means of a bypass. On August 21st, the wound was cleaned for another time, which has helped the wound to start curing."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,How satisfied are you with your current treatment?,"Since the wound has started to cure, it has been fine. Every now and then, I am coming for a check-up."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,What are your thoughts on the use of living bacteria for the treatment of wound infections?,"Considering grubs, living material on wounds is not a bad idea. If it is safe and it works, why not? I think it is better than antibiotics, which cause resistance and a lot of side-effects on the liver and kidneys when used systemically, like in my case."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Conclusions,"In this ethical analysis, we reflected on our Gelcatraz design with respect to five values: public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation and justice & fairness. We conclude that our product benefits individuals as well as society, and that its benefits and burdens are well-distributed.  We identified some issues that need to be addressed, such as the use of Gelcatraz by amateurs and the yet unidentified risks introduced by synthetic biochemistries. However, we believe that these risks are mostly covered by the several safety levels we integrated in the design."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Ethics Discussion,
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Getting started: Meeting with an ethicist,"To examine the ethical implications of our iGEM project, we contacted Dr. Lily Frank.
                        She is an assistant professor of Philosophy and Ethics at Eindhoven University of
                        Technology and is specialized in Biomedical Ethics. With Lily we discussed the
                        potential benefits and dangers of synthetic biology, and she pointed us at some
                        of the most controversial issues related to synthetic biology. For instance,
                        Lily strongly recommended us not to choose an application which must be tested in developing
                        countries. Instead, we should test our product close to home where the required
                        infrastructure for safe testing is available. Furthermore, we learned that the
                        relative novelty of synthetic biology  as a field combined with slow politics
                        complicates risk assessment, as many of the potential benefits and risks are still
                        uncertain or have been ignored.
                    "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Ethical frameworks,"Lily was so kind to suggest some ethical frameworks to get started with our ethical discussion. She particularly recommended frameworks resulting from the European project SYNBIOSAFE (2009) and from work performed by the US Presidential Commission on Bioethics in 2010 (1). As Europeans, we were quite interested in the European view on the SynBio case. However, we found the European framework a collection of potential issues and concepts rather than a framework useful for an ethical analysis. As Lily Frank shared our preference for the American framework, we decided to use this one for our analysis. In the discussion, we also touch upon some points extracted from SYNBIOSAFE.We realize that some of the positions taken by the US Presidential Commission are themselves debatable. However, we consider it beyond the scope of this ethical analysis to debate the framework. In the next section, we will briefly explain the used framework before applying it to our project Gelcatraz."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Analysis,"The American report New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technology (2010) was a result of six months of work commissioned by president Obama, in response to the development of the first self-replicating artificial bacterial cell in 2009 (1). For six months, they consulted approximately thirty experts and received written comments which discussed the risks and benefits of synthetic biology. The commission concluded that synthetic biology should be approached with “prudent vigilance”. This means it is not necessary to implement new regulations or even discontinue research in the field of synthetic biology, but that the developments of the field should be continuously monitored. They invite scientists and public policy makers to assess the risks, benefits and moral objections   of new projects and their implications, and they strongly advice to engage stakeholders, scientists and the public in this debate. In fact, such evaluation is well captured by iGEM’s Human Practices process.The commission found five guiding principles for the evaluation of synthetic biology processes and products: public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation and justice & fairness. Below, we discuss our project in the context of each of these five values."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,1. Public beneficence,"The value public beneficence is defined as the maximization of public benefits and the minimization of public harm. This principle should be applied to the individual, institutional, community and public levels. The commission advises to be vigilant about harms.Our entire human practice trajectory was performed with the aim of optimizing public beneficence and minimizing the harmful side effects of our design. For instance, we ensured optimal entrapment of bacteria in the gel, designed a kill switch to minimize the risks associated with bacterial escape, added an additional bacteriocin to our secretion system to eradicate additional malignant bacteria and researched the options for replacement of toxic chemicals during the synthesis of the hydrogel. This process is documented on the safe-by-design page. The final bandage resulted from input from stakeholders and expert on our designs. This process was further supported by a stakeholder-value analysis  we performed based on the iGEM'ers Guide to the Future.We believe that our product benefits individuals as well as society, by improving patients’ quality of life, improving public health, lowering the prevalence of antibiotics resistance and eventually reducing health care costs.   These benefits are extensively explained on the applied design page. For instance, we enabled the secretion of active lysostaphin by E. coli. This eliminates the need for expensive laboratory equipment other than the standard equipment available in modest laboratories for the production and purification of lysostaphin. This will allow scientists with all budgets to produce lysostaphin of high purity. Currently, drugs sold in developing countries are often of lower purity than drugs used in developed countries (2). Hopefully, patients in developing as well as developed countries will benefit from a treatment with highly pure lysostaphin.We identified the main risk introduced by our design as the escape of GMOs into the environment. We however believe that we minimize this risk using a proper adhesin. We consider the addition of a kill switch to our system in the future. This will add an additional layer of safety to Gelcatraz. However, it will make the system more expensive. This may not be desirable as it may prevent scientists with a limited budget from using our platform. In contrast, without the kill switch, the low costs of our system and its user-friendliness make Gelcatraz accessible to any scientist with basic equipment."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,2. Responsible stewardship,"The committee believes that scientists involved with SynBio must think and act for the advancement of all, thus also for those who cannot talk. Examples of the latter are nonhuman species, the environment and future generations. Challenges recognized by the commission are firstly our incomplete and uncertain understanding of the potential risks and benefits of synthetic biology, and secondly the risk of intentional misuse of SynBio technologies. Once again, the commission stresses the importance of prudent vigilance here, rather than being action-oriented or extremely cautious.Insofar as we can judge with our current knowledge, the plaster as we designed it seems to globally advance people. Patients suffering from chronic wounds or burn wounds will benefit from the plaster, and so will other people as our design diminishes the burden of antibiotic resistance. It may be argued that animals also benefit from the latter, as they also suffer from bacterial infections. Moreover, the plaster could replace current antibiotics administered to livestock. Things get more complicated when we consider Gelcatraz as a platform for GMO use outside of the laboratory. By making working with GMOs safer and more convenient, we may accelerate the use of GMOs in regulated environments as well as in less controlled environments. The desirability of the widespread use of GMOs could be the topic of a separate ethical discussion and is beyond the scope of this analysis. Nevertheless, we should only launch our system for use outside of laboratories if the safety of our device can be demonstrated and regulations should ensure that only GMOs classified as ‘low-risk’ are allowed. When people use Gelcatraz within a laboratory environment, they do not need special equipment to work safely with the platform.Another reason why prudent vigilance would be important comes from the dealing with novel technologies which have not yet been thoroughly tested. Interestingly, SYNBIOSAFE highlighted the need for new risk assessment methods in three cases: a) when larger DNA-based circuits are built based on individual ‘parts’, b) when new minimal organisms are designed and c) when alternative biochemical structures are involved (3). The first case is generally applicable to iGEM with its emphasis on BioBricking. Although we do build new circuits, their complexity remains limited. This means that the functioning of the circuits should remain predictable, limiting the additional risks involved. We also tested our constructs thoroughly. The latter two cases are not directly related to our project, but the third one may be if we implement an artificial amino acid-based kill switch. Although we would implement the kill switch to enhance the safety of our design, we should be aware of the level of unpredictability added by such a novel biochemistry. The authors do not elaborate on the type of risk assessment methods they envision. However, the need for new risk assessment methods means that we must take a vigilant stance during the design process."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,3. Intellectual freedom and responsibility,"Here, the risk of malevolent ‘dual-use’ should be recognized. That is, the abuse of SynBio technologies for dubious cases. The commission does not believe that this risk is high enough to justify the limitation of intellectual freedom. Instead, it calls for “regulatory parsimony”: no more surveillance than strictly required to ensure justice, fairness, security, and safety, as this may hamper progress of science and technology and may even prevent the development of safeguards. SYNBIOSAFE is more careful with respect to dual-use. They believe that the risk of intentional misuse has been neglected in previous discussions.In this context, it is problematic that we cannot control the type of applications that we will facilitate with Gelcatraz. This means that we may potentially facilitate the use of GMO for harmful ends. However, the question is whether people using GMOs for dark purposes will benefit from our design, as we designed Gelcatraz with an emphasis on safety. People aiming to abuse GMOs probably do not care much about safety and may therefore not turn to our platform.SYNBIOSAFE also addresses the possible diffusion of synthetic biology to amateur biologists. Considering that Gelcatraz has been designed not only for safety but also for convenience, it may offer an interesting platform to amateurs. This may be worrisome if amateurs are not aware or do not care about appropriate safety measures. We therefore agree with SYNBIOSAFE’s call for regulation and training in biosafety techniques. However, our platform has been designed as a platform for the use of already manipulated and tested bacteria. This means that only ‘amateurs’ capable of the initial steps needed to, for instance, equip their bacteria with the required adhesin. We therefore do not believe that our platform will attract fully inexperienced users."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,4. Democratic deliberation,"The presidential commission stresses the importance of an ongoing public debate and the search for common grounds on a topic so controversial as synthetic biology. The commission argues that decisions need not to be binding, as new information may challenge those decisions. Instead, the deliberative process should be ongoing. However, the commission seems to assume that the general public knows enough about synthetic biology to formulate an opinion. We think that often, the required knowledge is missing. Therefore, it may be good to inform people about the field of synthetic biology before asking them for their opinion. It is important that the provided education is objective. We believe that the democratic deliberation process is very much encouraged by the iGEM competition in the form of education and outreach, and feel that it is reflected by our outreach efforts."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,5. Justice and fairness,"The commission calls for a fair distribution of benefits, burdens and risks across society and globally. We opted for an application which is relevant for people all across the globe, as Staphylococcus aureus is everywhere (4). To fairly distribute the risks, Gelcatraz as a platform and the resulting wound plaster must be extensively tested in the Netherlands before making it available to other countries. That will ensure that (clinical) tests are performed in a setting with all the required safety precautions. Once Gelcatraz is considered safe to use, it can be adopted by anyone with access to a laboratory with standard equipment. As no special equipment is required for the safe use of Gelcatraz, scientists with all budgets may benefit from its use. As discussed above, patients will globally benefit from lysostaphin secretion and its integration in a wound healing plaster.Although the main benefits of our design will be enjoyed by a certain group of patients, the entire (Dutch) society and even world will benefit from reduced antibiotics resistance. Escape of bacteria, although unlikely, would mainly affect patients and their surroundings. The effects would however be minimal thanks to the several layers of security (weakened, benign bacterial strain unable of survival outside of the hydrogel). From the safety analysis performed for the safe-by-design challenge,  it can be concluded that people exposed to our platform for their jobs (e.g. medical doctors, nurses, people working in waste processing or manufacturing) will not suffer from this."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Safe-by-Design,"The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) challenged us to take part in their safe-by-design challenge. This challenge was about integrating safety into different phases of our project. To get started, we wrote a proposal which we discussed with RIVM experts over Skype. We got to realize that safety goes beyond technical issues and that it is important to consider safety from the initial ideation stage to the final implementation.For this project, we broke safety down into eight different issues, which we had recognized with the help of some stakeholders and experts (see our integrated practices). Once we had identified the main issues, we consulted more experts and stakeholders to think of possible solutions. An overview of our Safe-by-Design trajectory can be found in the infographic below. The details are provided underneath."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Start of the trajectory ,"Experts: Korienke Smit and Niek Savelkoul (RIVM)We wrote a proposal in which we outlined our safety plans. In a subsequent Skype call, we received feedback on our proposal from two RIVM experts. Their main feedback was that we should only discuss safety in the context of our own project, rather than focusing on general safety-related topics."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Bacterial escape,"Problem: We need a safe method for working with E. coli which prevents its escape into the environment.Experts: Prof. Jan van Hest, Cécile van der Vlugt (RIVM)Solution: Our hydrogel-adhesin system would prevent leakage. Incorporation of dependence on an artificial amino acid ensures that E. coli would not be able to survive outside the gel.More information"
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Antibiotics reduction,"Problem: The use of antibiotics in R&D  does not pose a major threat, but antibiotic resistance in general is an urgent problem requiring alternative solutions.Experts: Prof. Van Hest, Plasmacure, PAMM, Maasstad Hospital, Cécile van der Vlugt (RIVM)Solution: Secretion of bacteriocins as an alternative to antibioticsMore information"
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Working with Staphylococcus aureus,Problem: S. aureus is a pathogenic BSL2 species. How do we prevent unsafe situations for team members while testing our bacteriocin?Experts: PAMMSolution: Collaborate with PAMM to use their well-equipped laboratories and expertise on working with these dangerous bacteria.More information
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Good Manufacturing Practices,"Problem: Our hydrogel production requires toxic catalysts and yields a hazardous intermediate product.
                        How to ensure a save synthesis and polymerization process and prevent the presence of toxic intermediates in
                        the final product? Furthermore, chemical waste should be minimized.Experts: Cécile van der Vlugt (RIVM), Lori GoffSolution: Extensive dialysis of methacrylated dextran removes all toxic components. The use of a
                        novel, radiation-based crosslinking method and alternative catalysts could reduce the toxicity of the
                        synthesis and polymerization. The gel is biodegradable.More information"
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Toxic chemicals and intermediates ,"Dextran itself is biocompatible and safe, but its synthesis and polymerization require several toxic
                            chemicals. Furthermore, some toxic intermediates are produced.  While handling these chemicals, we
                            take all required precautions such as working in the fume hood and wearing protective gloves.
                            However, it would be even better to replace them by less toxic equivalents. We researched
                            replacement options for two steps: the synthesis of methacrylated dextran and polymerization of
                            methacrylated dextran into gels.
                        "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Synthesis of methacrylated dextran,"For the synthesis of the gel, we use some toxic chemicals, the most important being glycidyl
                            methacrylate (GMA) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). GMA is carcinogenic but required to
                            functionalize the hydroxyl groups of dextran. We handle it with syringes to avoid exposure.
                            Furthermore, we remove all traces of GMA after the synthesis and confirmed this with H-NMR.
                            The final product is thus completely safe. DMAP is a base that acts as a catalyst for the
                            coupling of GMA to the dextran molecules. It is toxic if swallowed and fatal in contact with
                            skin. In the absence of a catalyst, no GMA incorporation could be detected (5). However, we
                            researched alternatives to catalyse the reaction. Triethylamine and pyridine are no reasonable
                            alternatives due to the associated high conversion times (5).  Another alternative for DMAP
                            could be tri-ethylenediamine, also known as DABCO. DABCO is like DMAP an organic base and
                            therefore it can theoretically catalyse the methacrylation reaction. However, unlike DMAP,
                            DABCO possesses less toxic properties and DABCO is much safer to handle than DMAP. DABCO is
                            from an economical point of view also a better choice as its commercially available for a lower
                            price. A downside to using DABCO as a catalyst for this methacrylation reaction is that it is
                            less basic than DMAP (6). As the deprotonation of hydroxyl groups by a base is the driving force
                            for the reaction, the reaction time will most likely increase when DABCO is employed as a
                            catalyst instead of DMAP. A comparison of the performance of DABCO in our reaction is required
                            to make an informed choice between DMAP and DABCO.
                        Methacrylation of the non-hazardous dextran results in molecules with very toxic and carcinogenic
                            properties due to the reactive methacryl groups (7).  No material safety data sheet exist for
                            methacrylated dextran. To safely handle this toxic viscous oil, it is kept in the fume hood at
                            all times and only handled using piston pipettes or syringes. To purify the methacrylated
                            dextran from the organic mixture, we dialyse it against demineralized water. To verify the
                            complete removal of the DMSO, DMAP and GMA, the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the
                            dialyzed reaction product was compared with the spectra of pure DMAP and GMA. After 72 hours of
                            dialysis, trace amounts of unidentified by-products could be observed in the NMR spectrum. After
                            one week of dialysis, no more trace amounts of any reactants or byproducts can be observed. The
                            obtained spectrum matches with the one reported in the literature (8). The spectrum of purified
                            dextran can be seen in the hydrogel results.
                        "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Polymerization of methacrylated dextran,"To form the hydrogel, the methacrylated dextran polymers are crosslinked by radical
                            polymerisation in water. The polymerisation is initiated by tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)
                            and ammonium persulfate (APS). TEMED catalyses the homolytic scission of APS to generate
                            radicals which crosslink the methacrylate groups, resulting in the formation of a hydrogel. APS
                            and TEMED are both flammable and irritable. Because TEMED is a catalyst, we only work with
                            small amounts of the substance (10 microliter at a time) using pipets, reducing the risks
                            associated with this compound. TEMED is vital for the liberation of radicals from APS. In the
                            absence of TEMED, polymerisation at room temperature by solely APS is slow, so at -20°C the
                            polymerisation would be even slower (5).
                        Recently, an alternative approach to crosslinking methacrylated dextran polymers into a hydrogel
                            is has been developed, using radiation instead of the APS TEMED system. This approach
                            circumvents the use of toxic crosslinkers. If the methacrylated dextran monomers are pure,
                            the crosslinked hydrogel is devoid of unreacted small molecules and no further purification
                            is necessary. Additionally, if a high enough radiation dose is applied, typically 25 kGy, the
                            gel is sterilized simultaneously allowing immediate seeding. Crosslinking by radiation is
                            therefore a very promising option for dextran hydrogel synthesis on an industrial scale (7).
                        "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Hydrogel leakage test,"1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to verify that during storage in
                            demineralized water, no dextran or other starting products leak from the hydrogel. Trace
                            amounts of organic residue were detected but could not be assigned. Besides the solvent peak,
                            there is no overlap between the spectra of DMAP, GMA and that of the storage water as can be
                            seen below.
                        "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Hydrogel synthesis,"Only aqueous waste is produced during the synthesis of methacrylated dextran and the polymerisation
                            into a hydrogel. Aqueous waste is water with small amounts of organic molecules dissolved in it.
                            In our case these are organic molecules are the solvent DMSO, DMAP, unreacted GMA and methacrylated
                            dextran, NaOH, HCl, synthesis byproducts and byproducts formed during the radical polymerisation
                            (including unreacted methacrylated dextran). None of the waste products can be recycled due to
                            dilution or contamination with other compounds.
                        Especially during dialysis, a large amount of aqueous waste is generated. Approximately 50 liters
                            of aqueous waste is produced for 80 mL of hydrogel. The amount of waste can be drastically reduced
                            by changing using a smaller dialysis volume. We used a dialysis volume of 4 litres to accelerate
                            the dialysis. If a smaller volume would be used and equilibrium between the dialysis bag and the
                            medium is established each time, we expect that we can halve the amount of waste, at the cost of a
                            longer purification duration.
                        "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,After use,"The dextran-GMA hydrogel is biodegradable and is therefore safe to use in ecological environments.
                            The bacteria are equipped with a kill switch which will also kill the bacteria after the patch
                            has served its function and is thrown away. In this fashion waste production is kept at a minimum.
                        "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Costs,"We are using a dextran hydrogel for our system. Medical-grade dextran is expensive. However, the
                            production of one hydrogel only requires small quantities (100 μg). Therefore, the estimated
                            dextran costs for making one 400 μL hydrogel in patch form is around €0,65. Adding other reagents
                            will bring the total costs to approximately €1,00 for one hydrogel in small scale conditions.
                            These costs can be optimized by upscaling. Modifying the bacteria is a one-time expenditure.
                            Afterwards they can be cultured and re-used for a long period. Culturing the bacteria can be
                            performed on a large scale. Costs of medium are very low. Overall, our living material can be
                            produced very cost-efficiently and upscaling would further reduce cost. Before seeding our
                            hydrogel with bacteria, they can be modified for expression of different proteins. By also
                            culturing these bacteria that express infection-reducing enzymes, patches that fight infections
                            can be created by a very modest increase in costs.
                        "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Conclusion,"The concept of Safe-by-Design helped us to prioritize safety during all stages of the project. Thanks to many interactions with stakeholders, we recognized potential problems early on and found creative solutions. We believe that this resulted in a living material and wound healing bandage which will be safe for scientists, patients, medical professionals and the environment. Extensive (clinical) tests will need to verify this. We want to thank all stakeholders that helped us during the process. Without your help, we could not have considered as many aspects of safety!"
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Patient safety ,"Problem: We should not only cure patients, but also avoid their infection with E. coli and inflammation of the patch.Experts: Plasmacure, Maasstad Hospital , Dr. Edgar Peters, Dr. Jacques Neyens, M.D. Lesley BouwerSolution: Dextran is biocompatible, the used bacteriocins seem safe to humans (clinical trials still required). Our E. coli strain is harmless. More information"
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Occupational safety and health,"Problem: We must make sure that medical professionals work safely with the plaster.Experts: Maasstad Hospital , Dr. Edgar PetersSolution: The plaster will be convenient to apply. The gel is biocompatible, free of toxins and E. coli is non-malignant.More information"
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Infiltration,"Problem: We want to prevent foreign bacteria from invading the gel to avoid them from competing with E. coli for resources.Experts: Dr. Sandra Hoffman, iGEM Düsseldorf 2018, PAMM, Dr. Edgar PetersSolution: The risk of infiltration is relatively low thanks to the secreted
                        bacteriocins. We may lower the risk by means of a quorum sensing system and the
                        regular replacement of the plaster.
                    More information"
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Changing the plaster,"A simple measure may be frequent replacement of the plaster. This would ensure fresh nutrients and fresh E. coli bacteria. A disadvantage of this is inconvenience for the patient, which was highlighted by doctors from the Maasstad Hospital. Clinical studies will need to show the optimal treatment duration and replacement frequency."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Quorum Sensing,"Bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate activities on a larger scale. This is mostly intraspecies but the molecule AI-2 (Autoinducer 2) has been suggested to be a universal quorum sensing molecule, allowing inter-species communication. Production of this molecule has been found in a wide range of both gram-positive and gram-negative species, by means of the protein LuxS (11). By implementing a luxS knockout in our own bacteria, combined with an AI-sensing gene we can induce production of bactericides upon invasion of unwanted bacteria into our living material. A similar mechanism has also been attempted by NTU-Singapore 2008 iGEM team."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Silver coating,"Many metals have antibacterial properties (oligodynamic effect), but silver is the most effective and the least toxic to humans (16). It is commonly used in medical treatments. Silver ion release from silver composites has also been presented as an effect antimicrobial method (17).However, silver has both an effect on S. aureus and E. coli. Gram-negative bacteria such as E.coli suffer more structural damage from silver than Gram-positive bacteria like S. aureus (18)."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Overcrowding,"Problem: We should prevent the material from E. coli overcrowding.Experts: iGEM Düsseldorf 2018 (see collaborations page )Solution: The risk of overcrowding is low, as E. coli uses most of its resources for protein production. However, we could use a quorum sensing system such as the construct developed by iGEM Düsseldorf 2018.More information"
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Introduction,"As we wanted to improve our project for the people who would be working, handling or get in contact
                      with our product, we performed a stakeholder-value analysis. This analysis was inspired by the
                      iGEM'ers Guide to the Future.
                      We started with a brainstorm session during which we settled on the relevant stakeholders and values.
                      This gave us a good overview of who we wanted to talk to and what we wanted to discuss with them.
                      Inspired by interactions with stakeholders and readings, team members filled the matrix with post-it
                      notes over the course of the summer. Afterwards, we analyzed the findings. We will shortly discuss
                      the most important beneficial aspects of our project to the stakeholders and the main problems to
                      overcome in the stakeholders’ interests.
                    "
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,The matrix,What our matrix looked like after the summer:
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Patients,"The end-users, the patients, should have the most comfortable and easy experience using our patch for their wounds. Since it is a gel-like structure, treatment will be painless and continuous, reducing stress and effort to get the treatment. Placement of the patch can take place at home and replacement should be done less often compared to band aid. This not only reduces stress, inconvenience and pain as we learned from the Maasstad burn wound center , but fewer actions will also reduce costs. As developers of the patch it is also our task to make it chemically safe. The chemicals secreted by the bacteria in the patch are harmless to humans and have no known side-effects, but the chemicals used to produce the gel are very toxic on their own. To reduce the risk of these compounds, our gel is washed several times after synthesizing to remove those chemicals. However the possibility is also there to replace them with less toxic chemicals. Overall, patient safety seems to be guaranteed. The issues of patient safety and chemical toxicity are discussed under safe-by-design."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Scientists/iGEM,"We, the scientists working on the wound healing patch, have the main responsibility to make the product as safe as possible for every stakeholder. The safety aspect for us or other scientists working on this patch is again safely handling the chemicals used. This means taking the necessary safety precautions like wearing gloves or work in a fumehood etc. Decreasing toxicity of the chemicals by replacing them with less dangerous compounds will also greatly help with safely working on this patch."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Physicians,"Physicians have the general responsibility to get people the best treatment possible. Our wound healing patch helps physicians provide the best treatment, since it our patch is specific for long lasting, infected wounds. The specificity of the bacteria that are killed by the patch has the advantage of reducing chances of developing resistances among a lot of other bacteria on the skin. Resistant bacteria are already a problem in infected wounds, as emphasized to us by the medical doctors we interacted with. Another advantage of the patch for physicians is the fact that it can be freeze-dried and thus stored effectively for a long time and is ready off-the-shelf. This makes prescriptions and availability easier."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Hospitals,"Hospitals have similar interests as physicians: fighting resistant bacteria via the reduced use of common antibiotics and easy storage through freeze-drying. At the same time, limiting the treatment cost is a high priority for hospitals."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Nurses,"For the people applying the patch, the nurses, ease of application is important. This is ensured by designing the patch like band-aid. This is also important for their skills on using it, as not much has to be changed in their training or surroundings to learn how to apply such a patch. However, as they are the ones handling the wound healing patch, they are concerned by making the patch as safe as possible as well. Reducing chemical toxicity is their main interest along with the fact that the bacteria inside the gel do not pose a risk to the nurses."
TU-Eindhoven,Human Practices,Insurance companies,"Our contact at Plasmacure, Koen Lim, had been working for several insurance companies. He could thus inform us about the wound care market, as we described on the Applied Design page. Koen Lim expected that our product will drastically decrease health care costs once it is fully functional. Wound care currently costs Dutch society over 3 billion euros (1), so a cost reduction would be welcomed by insurance companies.SocietyAs the increasing antibiotic resistance of bacteria is a major problem for society, it is our responsibility to reduce the systemic use of these antibiotics. We are trying to achieve this by using bacteriocins, and not common antibiotics to reduce the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria. Another thing that we have to take into account however is that there is fear among people about the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). People are afraid of potential dangers. As an iGEM team, it is thus importance to increase awareness of the benefits of GMOs as well as of the danger of and preventive measures against antibiotic resistance. On top of that, we should highlight the additional safety layers introduced by our design. We tried to contribute to this through our education and outreach.GovernmentThe government is responsible for regulations to ensure GMO safety. As Gelcatraz introduces a safer method of working with GMOs outside of the laboratory, it may form an incentive to reconsider the regulations in certain cases. Obviously, this should only happen when the safety is guaranteed and will require a social debate. Furthermore, the government is faced with the problem of antibiotic resistance. Charged with the responsibility of finding a solution, the government would most likely welcome our alternative treatment of wound infections. Lastly, the treatment of infected wounds is an extremely expensive business due to repetitive, costly treatments. Since our patch would speed up wound healing and reduces costs, it would be beneficial for the government.ManufacturersFor manufacturers different topics are relevant. To guarantee the safe production of the wound healing patch, it has to meet the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) every therapeutic has to meet: precise description of production from raw material to fully functional patch. This will establish a safe production process. However, an efficient production process is just as meaningful for manufacturers. The volume in which gel is produced, is scalable and the catalyst used for the gel production is reusable. This is all documented on the safe-by-design page. Unfortunately, in upscaled production, gels are more prone to errors. Testing the gels on the demanded properties is the manufacturers responsibility, but this should be straightforward. Besides being more prone to errors, our gel is not recyclable to make new gels, but the gels can however be stored efficiently using freeze-drying.EnvironmentLow toxicity is of interest to the environment as well as to other stakeholders. The same applies to the prevention of bacterial escape from the gel. To reduce survival rates of potentially escaped bacteria, we use a kill switch. As explained under safe-by-design, this means that survival outside of the gel is not possible for our bacteria. Moreover, our bacteria can easily be killed using regular antibiotics. To conclude, Gelcatraz should not pose significant threats to the environments when it is used responsibly."
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,Netherlands Biotechnology Congress,"Our first conference! With the other Dutch iGEM teams, we were invited to present a poster at the Netherlands Biotechnology Congress. During the several talks we learned about new developments in biotechnology and public acceptance of GMOs. The highlight of the day was an intriguing talk by Marc Lynas, a British environmental activist and journalist who explained how he moved from violently opposing GMO crops to supporting them. The conference also offered a platform to discuss our project with biotechnologists and with the overgrad winning team of iGEM 2017, TU Delft. After a few drinks and a good meal, we returned home with a lot of new insights."
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,TU/e contest,"We were recruited for the TU/e contest in February. At first there was a selection round. We had the chance to propose the problem and solution that we have been working on. We were also brought in contact with coaches from several companies to see if they could help us with this project. This could be advice on any field of your project, from the specific details to how to approach the market. We talked to for example companies like Deloitte, Thermo Fischer, Medtronic and much more. Afterwards there was the moment of truth, the selection! We had a couple of days to collect as many votes as possible and to convince the coaches, friends and family that our project was worth sending to the next round… and we convinced them all! iGEM made the cut to the final 40 participants!After that came the business related part of the contest. We had the opportunities to go on speeddates with representatives from Medtronic, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Deloitte and BON. We also received a Golden Egg Check. This document helped us to design our project based around persons of interest and the market that you might want to end up in. We also received some very useful workshops, which varied from designing a business model to a pitch training. With help from the coaches, the feedback from the speeddates and the information from the workshops, we were able to finalize our Golden Egg Check and we made it to the final 20 participants for the final event! During the final event, we had to give a 1 minute pitch to convince everyone that our idea was the best. We put a lot of effort into turning our difficult idea into something easy to understand to a general public because most of the people present in the audience did not have biological knowledge or backgrounds. We did this so well, that we were able to collect the audience price of €1000!In the end, we are very happy that we participated in the TU/e Contest! The value that this contest added to how we look at our project has been very great and we can look back on a fun and useful contest!"
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,Dutch Technology Week,"The Dutch Technology Week (DTW) is all about promoting Dutch high-tech to the public. During this week, many high-tech companies opened their doors. This was a good opportunity to raise awareness about synthetic biology! We arranged a stand during the High-Tech Discovery Route. In order to make it more approachable to the general public, we had a stand to make hair gel and slime with kids. While some of us entertained the children, others got the opportunity to discuss our applications with the parents. Finally, we were allowed to give a pitch in order to promote iGEM during the business event."
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,Design of a course on synthetic biology for high school students,"To spread our love for synthetic biology, we collaborated with the Eindhoven School of Education (ESoE) to develop a course module for high school students consisting of four lessons and an experimental part. The actual design of the module was performed by three aspiring teachers from the ESoE. The module consists of several online modules based on the flip the classroom concept combined with a lesson at their school to prepare students for an experiment at our university. During the experiment they will modify E. coli to express GFP. Back at school, they will reflect on ethical issues raised by synthetic biology. We already made an appointment with a school in the region to execute the module when we return from Boston.After several feedback sessions, Marc, Lotte and Milan presented their work in front of teachers, students and our team. We are looking forward to the execution of the module and want to thank Marc, Lotte and Milan for the great work and the pleasant collaboration!"
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,European Meet-up Munich,"In July, we traveled to Munich for a meet-up organized by iGEM Munich. We had a great time meeting other iGEM teams, exchanging ideas and we received a lot of feedback on our design and potential problems. For instance, iGEM Düsseldorf warned us for the risk of overcrowding of the hydrogel upon long-term use. This resulted in a potential collaboration with them; we may be able to use their quorum sensing Biobrick to prevent overcrowding, or perhaps even to prevent infiltration of the material by foreign bacteria. We also received useful feedback from Julia Müller, a PhD candidate at TU München who is attempting to print hydrogels.We also came in contact with iGEM Hamburg. They were working on a project that involves a stable platform to seed their bacteria on. After talking about it, we concluded that our gel could help the project of Hamburg and they could help us with some degradation experiments of our gel. We decided that collaboration would be very useful and thus we are now working with Hamburg.  We would like to thank iGEM Munich for the perfect organization and all the participants for their feedback and ideas."
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,Freshers’ week,"During the introduction week for new students, we got the opportunity to promote iGEM at a fair. We talked to new students from all kinds of disciplines about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. The students were very curious to hear why we decided to spend our summer in the lab! We also introduced the new generation of scientists to our iGEM project and asked them whether they would wear a patch with bacteria on their skin. Interestingly, after sharing some information on the role of the bacteria in our design, they seemed to agree that they would wear the patch if we could ensure the safety of the patch."
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,Interview Bionieuws,"We were approached  by Bionieuws, which is a newspaper for biologists that provides interviews, scientific news and articles. We had the pleasure of providing a short summary about our project and together with the other five Dutch iGEM teams we were present in the 28th edition of Bionieuws that was released on the 8th of September. We were very happy that we had the opportunity to spread awareness of the iGEM competition and about our team and project amongst biologists and scientists. "
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,SensUs Event,On Saturday the 8th of September we were present at the SensUs event. This is a competition regarding molecular biosensors in which 13 international teams from all over the world participated. We had the opportunity to talk about our project to teams and public and discuss biological alternatives for antibiotics and the potential of biological biosensors.  Also we were spreading awareness about synthetic biology.
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,Interview Nederlandse Biotechnologie Vereniging,"The Nederlandse Biotechnologie Vereniging (or Dutch Association for Biotechnology) was interested in an article about all of the Dutch iGEM teams. We submitted a 300 word summary of our project and team and what it is that we are working on. On the 17th of September we were published online, and the articles of all the teams are published in the C2W newspaper that was due on the 12th of October. "
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,Interview NRC Handelsblad,"On Wednesday, the 19th of September we went to Utrecht for an interview with the NRC newspaper. NRC was interested in writing an article about all six of the Dutch iGEM teams and a meeting was scheduled for this. Groningen, Utrecht, Leiden and Eindhoven were present and we talked about several topics of the iGEM process. What is it exactly that you team is working on, how does a biobrick influence synthetic biology, do you interact with the public about your project, what happens with the research that you do, these were all questions that we discussed that day. It was a very informative afternoon and it was nice to see such a variety in teams since everyone is working on something different. We are very glad that NRC showed interest in iGEM and this can increase awareness for the iGEM competition, since it is a relatively unknown subject in Eindhoven."
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,Interview Cursor,"We scheduled an interview with the Cursor, the official newspaper of our University. This was about our team, what we did, our project, what we achieved and how Boston went for us. We aimed to attract more attention from our university to our team and the iGEM competition. There are several student teams on our university, and the iGEM team is not very well known outside the Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry Faculties. This is because we do not have something concrete toshow, like for instance a racing car. However via Cursor we hope that we can show everyone that synthetic biology is not just spending every day in the lab and only doing science, but that it is also socially very relevant and dealing with relevant problems and that synthetic biology might very well be the future of society."
TU-Eindhoven,Education & Public Engagement,Presentation event,"In addition to spreading awareness through the newspaper of our university, we also scheduled a presentation event. During this event, we did the presentation about Gelcatraz for students, the other student teams and the researchers that were interested or were wondering what it was exactly that we did in the months that we occupied some of the benches in the lab. We aimed to generate public interest into synthetic biology by showing what we did and how we can implement that to solving real world problems.  "
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Overview,"
We want sport competitions to be fair and athletes to be protected against gene doping, the misuse of gene therapy in sports. People caught up in the rat race of doping development underestimate the implications of gene doping, that can stretch beyond sports into public health and social inequality. To get an overview of the design requirements for gene doping detection, we organized a discussion with experts, athletes and coaches at the University of Stirling. We implemented athletes’ wishes regarding invasivity, privacy and testing frequency into our detection method. Further interaction with stakeholders such as the Dutch Doping Authority and Oxford Nanopore Technologies made us add a prescreen and a barcoding tool to our detection method for versatile, high throughput and reliable detection. As a final challenge, we invited engineers to hack our detection method, and used their collective strength to improve our algorithm and anticipate future gene doping developments.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,1. Anticipation,"
As a first stage in Responsible Research and Innovation we focussed on addressing the need for gene doping detection as well as on making an assessment of the challenges constituting gene doping with respect to the future.

            "
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,1.1 Relevance of Gene Doping Detection,"
    Due to a lack of an implemented detection method it is hard to assess whether gene doping is currently happening. We can say now however that it is a more eminent threat than you might have expected.In the timeline in figure 1 some of the most prominent events in gene doping development are sorted in time and as it appears gene doping might already be happening.
    We assessed the topic further through train debates and public surveys complemented by athlete interviews and contact with the Dutch Doping Authority as well as sports organizations as NOC*NSF, the Dutch National Sports Organization, and a sports psychologist. We found that up to 55% of the general public would like to use gene doping for performance enhancement without necessarily ascertaining its safety. These high figures amongst the general public together with the enormous pressure that is put on athletes give an indication of the need for detection. 
Figure 2. Statistics on the willingness of the general public to use gene doping for performance enhancement in The Netherlands and The People’s Republic of China based on 181 and 126 respondents respectively. More on the surveys in The Netherlands and China can be found on the Education and Public Outreach Page."
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2003: Genedoping,"
The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) puts gene doping on the list of prohibited substances.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2004: Marathon mice,"Geneticists at Howard Highes Medical Institute engineered so-called marathon mice that could run twice as far as normal mice by changing only a single gene, PPARdelta. (Wang et al. 2004)
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2006: German Coach (Thomas Springstein) Suspected of Genetic Doping.,"Thomas Springstein was a one-time coach of the German Athletics Association (DLV). He was convicted partly based on e-mail conversations, which were aquired by the police during a raid on his home. These e-mails brought up references to Repoxygen, a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia. Repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin (EPO), a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells, thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles. It was under preclinical development by Oxford Biomedica as a possible treatment for anaemia but was abandoned in 2003. (Michael Reinsch, 28 January 2006).
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2008: Chinese Doctor Offers Gene Doping to Athletes,"A German television report was brought out on the availability of gene doping in China shortly before the Beijing Olympics. In this documentary produced by ARD television, a Chinese doctor offers stem cell therapy to a reporter posing as an American swimming coach in return for $24,000, according to a translation provided by the ARD television. The documentary broadcast does not offer evidence that the hospital has provided gene doping to other athletes, but it does provide a shocking insight into the doping development scene. (NBC News 2008)"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2010: Gene Doping Detection: Evaluation of Approach for Direct Detection of Gene Transfer using Erythropoietin as a Model System,"In two mouse studies, blood was positive for a plasmid in some animals for 1–2 days and up to 1 or 4 weeks after intramuscular or intravenous administration. The sensitivity of PCR methods used in these studies was 100 or 1000 vector copies per mg of gDNA. In another study with mice injected rAAV intramuscularly, 12 whole blood samples from a high-dose group tested positive for viral DNA until day 28, but viral DNA in plasma was cleared within 3–4 days. The sensitivity of the method for vector detection in this study is comparable to that for the assays developed here. (Baoutina et al. 2010) "
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2016: Officials Fear Some Olympic Athletes Might Be Altering Their Genes To Cheat In Rio ,"Sarah Everts reported for Chemical and Engineering News that officials planned to test 2016 Rio athletes' tissue samples for markers of gene doping. The most likely subject of a genetic hack appears to be the gene that codes for EPO. Therefore, this gene became what the officials planned to test for. (Letzter et al. 2016) According to the International Olympic Committee’s medical and scientific director, Richard Budgett, samples collected in Rio will be tested for gene doping at some point after the games, even though the test hasn’t been run during the Olympics itself. (Everts, 2016) "
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2017: Doping Control Analysis at the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games,"The EPO gene is mostly expressed in renal cells, from where the EPO protein is secreted into the bloodstream. The identification of any concentration of EPO DNA sequences  in blood however, are considered a positive result for gene doping within current detection methods. Considering the growing concern over gene doping, as well as the EPO availability of new molecular biology tools, the Brazilian Doping Control Laboratory (LBCD) implemented, improved, and validated 2 amplification assays for EPO cDNA using the real-time PCR instrument QuantStudio12K (Thermo Fisher, São Paulo, Brazil). All work was performed with WADA-certified reference material for EPO gene doping within a range of 1 to 4000 copies of reference material spikes and EPO gene-doping-positive samples. However, in view of the absence of interlaboratory tests among the laboratories accredited by WADA, the analysis was not performed on the Olympic samples; it was only performed on samples selected exclusively for research. (Pereira, et al. 2017) "
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2018: ADOPE,"
Our enthusiastic team set out to tackle gene doping to promote responsible use of synthetic biology. Read more about our project here.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,1.2 Future Gene Doping Challenges,"
After we evaluated the relevance of gene doping detection, we focussed on the challenges of gene doping in the broadest context. We grouped the challenges involved in gene doping in the following categories: health (both private and public, global and intergenerational), responsibility and social inequality. As became apparent during the expert discussion in Stirling, exactly these topics make gene doping different from conventional types of doping.
     
We addressed the challenges described above with the creation of our detection method and discussed the topics in our expert discussion at the University of Stirling. Here we talked about why gene doping detection is so important and why it is extremely important to unite strengths. You can watch the movie on this discussion below.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2. Inclusion,"
    In Anticipation we discovered the topic of gene doping in the broadest sense, both scientifically as well as ethically and socially. Subsequently, we took it further as a part of the inclusion process to involve as many people as possible for optimal design requirements for everyone. Here are some of the approaches we took in involving people from science, from sports as well as the general public. 
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,2.1 Science,Here we elaborate on science related events that have largely influenced our project. At reflection and responsiveness we elaborate on individual stakeholders that have changed our project.
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Hackathon,"From our surveys we knew that 98% of the public feels strongly about maintaining strict doping controls. People feel that sports is only moderately fair and 75% is afraid of gene doping becoming a big problem in sports. These figures, and the strong collective spirit that was stressed in Stirling, prompted us to involve cyber security specialists in the fight against gene doping through the design of possible gene doping sequences.

On October 5th, 2018 we therefore organized a Hackathon at the Cyber Security Week in the Fokker Terminal in The Hague. The goal: engaging the public and especially computer scientists in developing their own gene doping sequences. We developed a software tool that learns from the ever growing database our participants helped create. In this way, we improve gene doping detection together, so that we are able to detect new approaches in gene doping and to be one step ahead of the doping developers. We think that together we are stronger, inspiring each other. Many computer scientists joined our event and provided us with useful input from a different perspective.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Engagement in Asia,"
    The way people value sports is just as diverse as the people who love it, all around the globe. That is why it is important to weigh opinions not only in the Netherlands, but in the Peoples’ Republic of China as well. During our time there organizing the iGEM Eurasian Meetup, we spoke with Dr. Li Wei at NIFTY prenatal screening, who works with cell free DNA as well. He confirmed our assumptions on the cfDNA levels in the blood and outlined several possibilities of detecting it, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of next generation sequencing with us. 

In addition, we spoke with Mr. Cao Jun, CEO of Sports Genomics Inc., on the future of genetic enhancement in amateur sports. His department’s main focus lies with helping people choose a sport that fits them based on their genetic information. For them, the border lies with reading the genetic information and recommending a course of action based on this, not enhancing.
During our time in China we furthermore handed out surveys in the streets, buses and subways. This gave some very interesting results as is further described on our Education and Public Outreach Page.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Train Debates and the Public Opinion,"
On the June 26th, we extended the Belgian Biotechnology Day to The Netherlands. We wanted to open up the discussion on synthetic biology with a broad public. In order to find a diverse audience we organized train debates all over The Netherlands. The topic we chose was gene editing, which at the same time provided us with valuable information for our project. We spoke with people with radically different ideas and background. We even happened to talk to a professional soccer player who was, anonymously, quite open in admitting he would use gene doping if it was safe and undetectable.

    More information on the scientific background of the set-up of our surveys and the results we achieved in both The Netherlands and China (during our visit to China for the EurAsian Meetup) can be found on the Education and Engagement page.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Athletes,"Apart from interaction with the general public and the diversity of experts present at the discussion in Stirling, we find it highly important to talk to athletes to see their perspective and take their experience and values into account.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Cameron Brodie,"
Cameron Brodie is a former professional swimmer, Scottish Record Holder (6x), British Champion (2015) and Commonwealth Games Medalist (2x), who performed at this top level next to his studies at the University of Stirling. He has only had experience with urine tests, the preferable testing method. However, he did say that blood tests would not be a huge problem, since as an athlete being in the competition is worth that. 

According to Brodie, the pressure to perform well is “really tough”. He can imagine young athletes being vulnerable to people approaching them with gene doping opportunities. It was only in lectures of his sport related University study program that he first learned about gene doping. He himself, would not like to use it though, because one cannot oversee the consequences.  
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Moniek Nijhuis,"
Being rewarded for your hard work is valuable for sporters. Moniek Nijhuis, finalist Olympic Games 2012 and medalist at multiple European and World Championships, told us her story about one of the bronze medals she won at the European Championships 2013. Two years later, this bronze medal turned out to be worth silver due to doping usage by one of her opponents. However, her moment of euphoria on the stage, which is the moment that sporters are striving for, will never return. 
Watch her view on doping use here."
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Sports Organizations and Athlete Surveys,"
We contacted several sports organizations including the Court of Arbitration for Sport and a sports psychologist, Jef Brouwers. Both were not aware of any cases of Gene Doping. Mr. Brouwers did indicate however that he is aware of athletes carefully selecting their partners to have children that hopefully will perform well in sport again.

Apart from this we contacted the National Dutch sports organization, the NOC*NSF, to hear about their experiences with gene doping. However, as they pointed out, they are not very familiar with the concept and the idea of it actually happening. They wanted to help to find out about the prevalence of gene doping though and set the initial steps to send out our athlete survey to all Dutch top level athletes. What became apparent from the athlete surveys we had already send out is that athletes highly value quick detection with a result within a few days. Furthermore, athletes tend to not mind privacy invasive tests, since they see it as inherent to the desire to be in sports. To us nevertheless, athletes' comfort and well-being remain top priority at all times.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,3.1 Value Sensitive Design,"
Based on the interaction with all stakeholders we then created a Value Sensitive Design to improve our strengths and reduce our weaknesses to satisfy everyone’s needs and preferences. In figure 8, an overview is given of our values, how they are related to values we identified through interaction and the design requirements that we implemented based on this. Below you can read more about how the stakeholders have influenced us in every step of our project.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,3.2 Influencers,"
There have been many people that have had impact on our project as can be seen in figure 9. Below we list the ones that have directly impacted the paths we walked in our project and how these stakeholders influenced us.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Sample Preparation,"
The Dutch National blood bank, Sanquin, has been of great influence for the development of our sample preparation. Sanquin is specialized in blood analysis and has it's own research departments to keep improving and developing new methods for the analysis of blood. Sanquin is responsible for all donor blood in the Netherlands, but is for example also specialized in tests focusing on the fetal cell free DNA in a mother's blood. This knowledge about analysis of DNA extracted from blood was exactly what was needed to develop a secure and optimized sample preparation for our project, ADOPE.

Two visits were made to Sanquin, one general introduction visit and one specialized visit where the specific DNA extraction method was taught to some of us. Aicha Ait Soussand and Ellen van der Schoot of the Experimental Immunohematology group of Sanquin helped us by explaining how they work with small fragments and DNA extraction and gave us access to their optimized extraction protocol used with the QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit. Since isolation of fragmented cell free DNA out of blood and white blood cells can be quite a hard challenge because of the low concentrations, the experience of Sanquin helped a lot in optimizing our DNA extraction method. In addition, they pointed at the delay in red blood cell development, which gave us the idea to extend our model to include the whole process of gene doping and its effect.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Targeted Sequencing,"Professor on Therapeutic Gene Modulation Hidde Haisma gave us insight in the most attractive methods for athletes for gene doping. Also, he gave us information on the detection possibilities for gene doping, for example the presence of exon-exon junctions due to the removal of introns, a distinct promotor for increased expression and viral vectors to penetrate into the human cells. Furthermore, he inspired us with his research in whole genome sequencing for gene doping detection and his limitations concerning data analysis. Reducing our data output for less complicated data analysis became one of our requirements for our gene doping detection method.
Alina Ham, Gerard Coyne and Angelica Vittori from Oxford Nanopore Technologies inspired us to adapt our initial idea, which would involve detection of target sequences based on dCas9-affinity and subsequent nanopore blocking. The forces exerted by the motor protein were suggested to overcome dCas9 affinity, and were most likely to push off the DNA-binding protein. This important advice made us change our project from a detection method based on signal absence towards a methodology striving for targeted sequencing.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Fusion Protein for Targeted Sequencing and Library Preparation,"The idea for our fusion protein came through several phases. We read about Zinc finger and Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), but wanted to improve on the versatility to anticipate the plethora of changes that could be made to the genes used as gene doping. Therefore, we came up with a Cas9 based protein with a flexible guide RNA library after elaborate discussions with amongst others prof. Stan Brouns. Later, during a presentation at the Delft Health Initiative, CRISPR experts challenged our approach because of the on and off target effects of dxCas9, but praised our idea for its versatility and thereby its probably functionality.

Prof. Chirlmin Joo and Viktoria Globyte advised us on this functionality of our fusion protein in its early stages, providing us with a confident start of the wet lab fusion protein production."
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Multiplexing and Barcoding,"Professor Hagan Bayley from Oxford University, one of the founders of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, pointed at the enrichment of our sample. This prompted us to focus on an extensive sample preparation. On top of this, prof. Bayley said that multiplexing and accompanying barcoding would be a big advantage, which we then set out to implement, improving upon an existing iGEM barcoding tool. 
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Prescreen,"Olivier de Hon, principal scientist at the Dutch Doping Authority, gave us highly valuable insights into the requirements that the doping authorities set for a detection method. A conversation with him resulted in our focus on the nanoparticle based prescreening method."
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Minimizing out of Competition Testing,"As became apparent from the interviews with Moniek Nijhuis and Cameron Brodie, out of competition testing can be highly privacy invasive in the sense that athletes always need to keep track of where they go. Therefore, we found it important to assess how to reduce testing time and optimally schedule possible testing points to have least impact on the athletes every-day life. To determine the optimal detection point for gene doping, we developed a model of the human body response to EPO gene doping, incorporating the blood cell development in the bone marrow based a suggestion by the Dutch National blood bank Sanquin.

Furthermore, Prof. Paul Dimeo from Stirling University prompted us to focus on athlete behavior, to think with them and thereby be a step ahead. We focussed on different administration methods for gene doping (intravenous and intramuscular) and on the effects of microdosing EPO gene doping. In this way we determined that our method could best be included in out of competition testing. See our model.
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,Safety-by-Design,"
For our team safety does not only come first. We prefer to say “safety always”. That is why we actively incorporated safety throughout our project, from the topic choice, focussing on responsible use of synthetic biology, to the product development, consisting of a cell free device. The RIVM, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, advised us on this. We concluded that from an environmental perspective unregulated gene doping use throughout society might pose another threat and thereby a reason for detection, at least in sports, and further awareness throughout society. In the image below an overview is given of how we incorporated safety throughout our project.  
"
TUDelft,Integrated Human Practices,The Future of our Method,"
The Dutch Doping Authority has shown interest in the implementation of our method and the Delft Sport Engineering Institute is interested in further support of our research. More on this can be read on the Entrepreneurship page. 
On top of this, we identified another market interested in our gene doping detection method: horse racing. Gene doping lately receives huge interest in the horse racing world. Earlier this year, the 37th Asian Racing Conference in Seoul specifically focussed on gene doping (Bloodhorse, 17 May 2018), illustrating the imminent threat of gene doping in this world.  

This year the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine even received $300.000 dollar towards the development of a gene doping detection system according to Kim Yuhl in the Online Pennsylvania Play Magazine (Yuhl et al. June 22, 2018). The Dutch Horse Racing Association has shown great interest in our product as we discuss on our Entrepreneurship page.

Apart from direct gene doping applications, the Dutch National Bloodbank Sanquin is working on methods for prenatal screening of diseases for which they have shown great interest in our method. On top of this, the RIKILT, the Dutch Research Department for Food Safety at Wageningen University and Research, world’s number 1 university for food technology, has shown interest in our method for safe food applications. These are only a few of the variety of extended applications of our targeted sequencing method. 
The Stan Brouns Lab at Delft University of Technology is so enthusiastic about our project that they want to develop our method of targeted sequencing for broader applications. Nevertheless, the fight against gene doping might be continued as well depending on a big grant application we started. Read more on the steps we have been taking towards the future applications on our Entrepreneurship page.

"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,Overview,"
As a team we realize the importance of education when it comes to shaping and sharing the future of synthetic biology. Therefore, we incorporated education and public outreach throughout our project to mutually learn and open up the discussion about developments that have the potential to inherently change our society. Our project, ADOPE, encompasses more than the design of a detection method for gene doping and stimulates people to actively be aware of the opportunities as well as the threats of synthetic biology as applied to gene technology and beyond. In the table below we give a brief overview of what we have done, how we did it and the achievements. 
"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,Interactive Virtual Reality Laboratory ,"
At the beginning of May, we started out with the innovative idea to create a Virtual Reality (VR) laboratory training environment. In this way, we want to innovate in education for highly interactive, less expensive and more encompassing laboratory preparation. The idea started with one of our team members who had relatively little laboratory experience because this is an expensive component for the education programs. We went into our own lab to measure everything, from the height of the benches to the dimensions of the pipet tips. In figure 1 you can see the result, our lab in real life and in virtual reality compared. We can make people experience our project with an app. Try it out yourself at our stand in the Exhibition Space during the Giant Jamboree. If you can’t wait, you can already take a look at our video shown below! 


Delft University of Technology is currently thinking about opening a VR learning center, which we hopefully brought a little closer with this idea. We pitched our VR laboratory to all study program coordinators of our faculty and have collected great interest. Hopefully, in this way, we will soon have safer, less expensive and more encompassing laboratory training. We would like to thank Arno Freeken, Luuk Goossen and Arend-Jan Krooneman from the Department of Architecture at Delft University of Technology for aiding in the development of our VR laboratory. 

"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,EurAsian Meetup Bioethics Workshop,"
Apart from developing a tool to teach students how to work in the laboratory as we did with our VR, we believe (young) scientists should also be taught about their ethical responsibilities that stretch beyond the laboratory. Therefore, we organized a workshop during the iGEM EurAsian Meetup with the topic: Bioethical dilemma’s across borders. The goal of this workshop was to increase the awareness of bioethics in the participants and to trigger reflection on the bioethical questions of their own projects.

We combined elements from the iGEMmers Guide to the Future (2017), advice given to us by Mr. Virgil Rerimassie, co-creator of this tool, and elements discussed by bioethicists Mr. Hui Kang and Britte Bouchaut, MSc. in their talks prior to the workshop. In mixed break-out groups, we discussed two topics with inherent ethical dilemmas that iGEM teams can face or have faced in the past: bioluminescence and gene drives. In the final round, the iGEM teams got together again and discussed how the same questions of the first two rounds could be applied to their own project.

We received positive feedback from the teams, many naming this workshop as one of the most useful parts of the meetup. Opinions still differed greatly, as illustrated by the quotes below.

Would you like to set up a similar workshop? Please see our contributions page for a hands-on-guide on setting up and moderating a bioethics workshop. 

"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,Hackaton,"
On October 5th, 2018, we organised a Hackathon during the Cyber Security Week. Here we challenged participants to try and beat our gene doping detection algorithm. The first goal of the Hackathon was to educated participants about synthetic biology and our project. The second goal to learn from the participants and the sequences they generated. In this way, we were able to make our algorithm more robust through the knowledge and sequences we gained while imparting some of our own knowledge on the participants. The Hackathon was a perfect of how learning can go both ways.
"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,High School Bioethics Debates,"
We think that also outside of iGEM children need to be brought in contact with bioethics and their own responsibility, whether this is in the development of technology or the use. Since the use of gene editing techniques are more and more widely available, we decided to visit high schools to start bioethics debates on this topic. Would they want to make use of DIY gene editing techniques? And why should they or should they not? More on the set-up of the debates can be found in the drop down below.
"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,Athlete Education,"
As a response to our debate in Stirling as well as to the athlete interviews, we identified the need for athlete education when it comes to gene doping. Therefore, we contacted the responsible doping authority to discuss the implementation of gene doping education for athletes. The Dutch Doping Authority however indicated that they don’t want to address it as a separate topic, but see it integrated with the current education material. In Scotland in the mean time, prof. Dimeo and Dr. Henning are continuing the implementation of specific gene doping education.
"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,Hotline,"
Who knows better the issues of an iGEM team as one of the iGEM teams? This motivated us to set up a low threshold platform to help iGEM teams from all over the world. Several teams contacted us via our special e-mail hotline.tudelft.igem@gmail.com
"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,Train Debates,"
With selective social media messages, people tend to be informed only about their immediate interests. It can be enlightning to talk to people and engage in an open debate, especially on a topic not many people from the general public know about: synthetic biology! On June 26th we decided to bring the Biotechnology Day from Belgium to the Netherlands by engaging people in a debate on gene technology on trains! 

Our team split up in three teams that travelled throughout the country. For mutual learning and engagement it is important to have a public as diverse as possible, and where to find this better than on trains that travel throughout a whole country? 

Not only did we inform and engage passengers, we also learnt from them about the general opinion on several aspects of our project through a survey. 75% indicated that there should be more public debates on developments in biotechnology in general to inform the public and reduce fear caused by ignorance. That was what we strived for with our outreach activities with which we on purpose tried to address the general public. 

One of our teammembers on a discussion in the train:
"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,Gene Doping in Society Surveys,"
We handed out surveys both during the train debates and in the public transports and streets during our time in China. From the start we focussed on reducing any survey response effects, which are unintended psychological effects influencing the responses of the respondents. We found alarmingly high numbers of people interested to use gene doping for performance enhancement among the general public in both The Netherlands as well as in China. This reinforced our project, to promote responsible use of synthetic biology. The topic certainly caught public interest and one person even wanted to contemplate longer before sending us the survey over the mail as can be seen in figure 9.

"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,Project Movie,"
To make our project understandable for the general public, we made a short movie about iGEM, our team and our project. 
"
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,National and International Publicity,"
When it comes to publicity, we started out small, reaching out to the media channels related to our University. Soon however, we were picked up by National and International news sites that stretched till the UK, Canada and beyond. One afternoon, we were googling our project and found that we even had been cited by media without our knowledge. This shows the extend to which our impact reached.
 
            "
TUDelft,Education and Engagement,Outreach Events,"
We attended many events to inform the public on synthetic biology and our project!
"
UAlberta,Integrated Human Practices,The Goal,"All images were taken by Team UAlberta with the consent of our interviewees.UAlberta 2018 wanted to create a project centred on our community. We did this by choosing to address an issue which was brought to our attention by an individual in our community, and by keeping stakeholders and their input involved in all aspects of our project. This was primarily done through interviews, where we asked not only for their expertise on the issue of Nosema and the practice of beekeeping but also questions about how we could improve our project, to best suit them. These interviews and what we learned from them are collated in our documentary.""By interviewing dozens of beekeepers, we were able to come to understand the full scope of their community. We designed a project that took into account what would work best for their lifestyles."".For example, beekeepers expressed to us that they wanted a product that could be applied similarly to  Fumagilin -  a previous treatment for Nosema. As a result we developed our project in a way that would potentially allow us to feed our construct to bees, mimicking the application method for fumagillin.Ultimately, Team UAlberta has created a project with a “community first” approach. This has lead to all aspects of our project being shaped by the connections we have built with members of the Alberta beekeeping community."
UAlberta,Integrated Human Practices,How did we integrate what we learned?,"At the beginning of the year team UAlberta knew that we wanted to work on a project that would be truly impactful in and outside of Alberta. Through our brain storming and preliminary research sessions, we realized that a project on bees would be the best way to do this. Our team was drawn to a project focused on bees; we are fearful of the negative impact that the loss of bees could have on people and the environment at large. More importantly, a project of this nature is was very applicable and meaningful in our direct community.We decided we wanted to ensure that we were creating a project focused on two fronts: on the bees we were passionate about, and on our direct community that we wanted to impact and help. We got in contact with Elizabeth Goldie (Liz) of the Calgary Beekeeping Association and our project took off. After a lengthy phone call with Liz and multiple emails, she sent  us an article by the Calgary Herald.   This article explained how different fungi were killing bees. Not only was this bad for the beekeeping community, it was heavily affecting other industries that depend on bee pollination. Crops such as blueberries, almonds, and many more were affected. From here, we learned about Nosema - and the basis of our project was formed.
However, we did not stop there. Before finalizing this as our project, we set out to meet more beekeepers to see if this was truly an issue they were concerned about in the way Liz was. We attended a talk by Dr. Medhat Nassar at a Calgary Beekeeping Association meeting wherein he spoke about Nosema. It was apparent from this meeting the beekeepers we met there believed that finding a solution to Nosema was critically important. We had completed our first goal of finding a project that was really meaningful to both our team and the community.
From there it was our goal to ensure that beekeepers and other stakeholders were consulted with about every aspect of our project. We wanted to connect with beekeepers both commercial and hobbyists en mass. We knew that we needed to talk to those who worked with bees on a government level and take into account government regulations. We also recognized the need to speak with the people who once produced Fumagilin and wanted to get involved with beekeeping at a corporate level. We then wanted to take what we learned from each of these actors and apply it to our entire project, while also giving back to the community. All of this coalesced in the production of our documentary.
This section is broken up into beekeepers, researchers, beekeeping associations, and other stakeholders that we spoke with."
UAlberta,Integrated Human Practices,Beekeepers:,"The primary stakeholder in this project is beekeepers. Through the process of the project we contacted hundreds of beekeepers through  exchanged emails, phone calls and in-person interviews with 16 beekeepers. Although  not all of the  interviews are shown in the documentary, they all contributed to our project in some way.Though the process of making our documentary and while trying to make our project as centered around the beekeeping community as possible, we asked questions which gave us insight only beekeepers could provide about bees. We asked what product would be best for them and about the effects of Nosema.It was making  the documentary that was the most rewarding experience in our attempt to produce the best possible research project . Beekeepers warmly welcomed us onto their factories, into their farms and spaces, into their homes and even to their families. Through our questioning we determined a few main goals. Firstly, we wanted to discover the ways in which our project would affect the community. Secondly, we wanted to find out how to improve our project meaningfully.   It turned out that most of the time these two things went hand in hand. 
We approached our Integrated Human Practices in a questions, answer, and then application process.Question: How has Nosema affected your operation? We asked this question because we wanted to gain a better understanding of how much of an impact Nosema could have on an operation, and determine whether or not our project was going to be impactful.Quotes: “We’ve experienced crashing in the spring from bees that heavy Nosema Levels” - Curtis MiedemaAnswer: Overwhelmingly beekeepers told us that Nosema has a very negative impact on their operations, because Nosema kills and as Curtis says, “less bees means less honey”. This means that a treatment for Nosema is desperately needed if beekeeping is to continue to flourish. Application: This reassured us that our project was going to have an impact on our community because it is needed. This told us that we had accomplished out main goal for human practices as we were tackling a problem that was negatively affecting our community. Question: How has the loss of fumagillin affected you and the beekeeping community? We wanted to ensure that beekeepers really wanted a new product, so that we could be assured our product would be useful.Quotes: “ There is a lot of panic around what people are going to do. Getting your bees through the winter is pretty much the most important part of beekeeping in this area.” - Paul Greidanus“It’s a little bit scary right now” - Randy Beaton.Answer: When we spoke to those in the beekeeping community, they made it clear that the loss of fumagillin was a detriment to their industry. When speaking with beekeepers they said that there was panic, fear, and shock in their community, caused by the loss of fumagillin. The loss is threatening because it means that beekeepers are more likely to be affected by Nosema, and by extension lose hives. But beekeepers also established that fumagillin was far from perfect, and so an alternative was needed regardless of its existence.Application: This made the importance of our project absolutely clear, as we had first-hand accounts of how detrimental Nosema could be, and the fear the loss of its only treatment was created.Question: How will this affect organic certification? An important trend in the food industry is the production of GMO free and organic products. Once we were able to provide them full information regarding our project, we found it important to get the perspectives of beekeepers, particularly commercial bee ranchers. This was because such research would affect a beekeeper’s organic certification.Answer: Through conversations with beekeepers we are confident that for the majority of beekeepers this will not be an issue. Beekeepers such as Paul Gredanious told us that in order to get organic certification for honey, your bees could not come in contact with anything non-organic. This means that organic beekeepers would not be able to use any Nosema treatments, feeds, or any form of additives on their bees. Moreover, the beekeepers had to ensure that their bees did not come in contact with GMO plants to the best of their ability. What this meant was that most honeybee ranchers already are not and cannot be organic certified because of the presence of GMOs in Alberta.Application: Our project would not have a massive effect on a beekeeper’s ability to get organic certification. However, it can be inferred that our product may actually be preferable because in status quo, the fumagillin beekeepers are using is mutagenic to mammals [1] which is not preferable for their farms and their customers. Beekeepers also seemed to be responsive to the idea that we were building on something from nature and enhancing it to help the bees.Question: Do you think the use of a GMOs will harm the consumers perception of your product? We thought it was important to ask this because we were trying to help beekeepers and improve their businesses not harm it. This means that the public perception of their product is important.Answer: As they already had history of working with GMOs, beekeepers expressed to us that they were willing to continue doing so as the practice helped protect food security as well as their livelihoods. They did, however, ask that if we gave them a product that it would be thoroughly tested. They additionally requested that the product be sold with a very in-depth explanation of what is was, so that beekeepers could truly understand the product and use it with confidence.Beekeepers were concerned that the construct would change the taste or appearance of the honey. This is because, as they explained to us, there is a ranking system for honey on the international level. Albertan honey is considered very high quality because of its mild taste and light colour. This is particularly popular in Japan, which is known for its high quality standards for food products.Application: Each time meeting with beekeepers, we provided an explanation of our project and remained in contact with them through its duration. If we were to turn this project into a business and actually sell this product, we would take their ideas into consideration. We would do this by providing a detailed explanation of what we are doing. We would also continually test the product to address concerns of long term effects.To address issues of the honey’s quality being reduced we attempted a biome experiment. This experiment was unsuccessful, so we asked researchers about how they thought our construct would affect the honey. They responded that they were sure that the construct would not change the colour of the honey.Question: Do you mind that the product would be a GMO? We thought this would be an important question to ask as many people are not fans of GMOs often due to personal belief.Quote: “Something that engineered or bred to actually reduce the problems of Nosema… its either that or we're not going to have any bees anymore.” - Randy BeatonAnswer: En masse beekeepers were not concerned about GMOs. Commercial beekeepers in particular understood that GMOs are an important part of food production, and that all crops are, to some extent, genetically modified.Application: This means that our product would likely be well received.Question: If we were to make this product what would be the best way to use it? We thought  this question would be important to ask; if we were to make a product we wanted to be widely utilized.Quote: “beekeeping industry has overcome a lot of adversity … beekeepers keep going, they are resilient, they work with that they have.” - Ursula Da RungaAnswer: Beekeepers suggested making a product similar to the way Fumagilin was used. This meant that our construct would need to be able to be fed to bees.  This was also a common way to distribute Fumagilin.Application: This suggestion from multiple beekeepers led to us using Bee. coli, as it was something that could be used by beekeepers in a feed form. It was also something that could live in a bee midgut.Question: Knowing everything about our product do you think you would use it? Quote: “As long as it works” - Paul GreidanusAnswer: Beekeepers told us that they liked and were excited about the project. They also told us that as long as it worked, they would use it as the is an immediate need for a solution.Application: There has been overwhelming support for the project by those who we interviewed. This has lead to us knowing that our project will be well received and have a positive impact.  This achieved our primary goal of helping the community."
UAlberta,Integrated Human Practices,Other Stakeholders,"We met with Ursula De Rugna, former CEO of Medivet. Medivet was a pharmaceutical company which produced Fumagilin, an antifungal treatment that was used for decades to treat Nosema. Recently, the production of Fumagilin was halted. Being the main source of income for Medivet, the company was force to go out of business. This loss of Fumagilin resulted in panic in the beekeeping community, and increased risk of Nosema infections.“It’s not gonna be pretty” - Ursula De RugnaUrsula is an important stakeholder to consider when discussing Nosema, because her product was responsible for the prevention of Nosema infections in Alberta. We felt that with her expertise she could give advice on how to improve our project. Ursula felt it was a good concept and encouraged us to look into Alberta regulations surrounding the production and application of this product. She also suggested that we explore patents; we have heeded both of her suggestions. Ursula  also reassured us that a treatment for Nosema was integral for beekeepers. She also spoke about how amazing beekeepers are, and how important it is that we do this work because Nosema puts that all of that at risk. “Beekeepers are amazing people”But Ursula also remained hopeful about the future of beekeeping the “beekeeping industry has overcome a lot of adversity… beekeepers keep going, they are resilient, they work with that they have.”"
UAlberta,Integrated Human Practices,Alberta government researchers.,"We were able to get in contact with Dr. Rassol Bahreini, an apiculture research scientist with the Government of Alberta who was able to advise us on our lab procedures in working with bees"
UAlberta,Integrated Human Practices,Beekeeping community,"Through our research we quickly learned that the Albertan beekeeping industry is the largest in Canada. Alberta’s honey is also world renowned, because of its light colour and mild taste. [2] A large part of the success of a the beekeeping community is their organizations. As  Ursula put it, “beekeeping is the poor cousin of farming”. As  a result, the beekeeping community depended on themselves and each other. They do this through various organizations that provide community and advocate for beekeepers. Thus, we got in contact with beekeeping associations. This provided us with the perspective of beekeepers as well as commercial perspectives. Team UAlberta also felt it was important to get in contact with these groups, learn from them, and receive their support.We first got in contact with was the Calgary Beekeeping Association. This is how we met Elizabeth Goldie, who was instrumental in the idea generation of our project. She also said that personally, she and many others would be thankful for any solution to Nosema. The organization also got us into contact with dozens of beekeepers, provided information regularly about how to care for bees in our lab and in general, and gave us their support.Next, we got in contact with the Alberta Beekeepers Association. This is a group that advocates for commercial beekeepers in Alberta. We met with a member of their board, Connie Phillips, who we bounced ideas off of about the finalization of our project. She helped us by providing solutions for real world implementation of this project, gave us contacts, and endorsed our project by providing financial aid. We are going to continue to build a relationship with this organization by presenting at 85th Annual Conference and Trade Show for the Alberta Beekeepers association, on November 5th.Finally we spoke with members of the Canadian Honey Council.Overall these groups were very helpful by providing contacts, and fielding questions about real world implication."
UAlberta,Integrated Human Practices,How we are giving back?,"Human practices decided that we wanted to give back to the community that gave so much integral information in the development and formation of our project.The first major way that we gave back to the community was through our documentary.   The  documentary allowed us to continuously speak to those who would be affected by our project, and learn about them. It  was also important because it would shine light on a community that is largely ignored. Many in Alberta, and by extension the world, do not know how important beekeeping is in Alberta . By completing the documentary, putting it online, and by giving it to the Alberta Beekeepers Association we have allowed many people to become aware of  Alberta beekeepers, hear their opinions, and learn of the issues that were affecting them. Beekeepers and the organization  chose  to support our documentary because they were excited by and saw the importance of these conversations,. They saw the platform we could provide them with to showcase their community and what they do.We are also going to continue to give back to the community by presenting at the 85th Annual Conference and Trade Show for the Alberta Beekeepers association, on November 5th. Though this is happening after the Jamboree, it is a commitment that we have made because we value the community. We believe that our contributions should stretch outside of what may benefit us through the iGEM  competition.Finally, we provided testing for Nosema of the beekeepers that we interacted with. This was a thank you to the beekeepers allowing us to interview them, and a way to assess how much the beekeepers we spoke with were affected by Nosema.This affected our project because it solidified our involvement with stakeholders and forced us to learn about their communities."
UAlberta,Integrated Human Practices,Ethics,"When considering ethics we wanted to make sure our research was premised on what we should do, not simply what we could do. The first major ethical consideration was what precautions we should take into account when designing our project, through the frame that it could actually be introduced into the environment. The second consideration was how to work with bees in a lab setting, as they are living creatures. We speak to many of our ethical considerations on the safety page.Our ultimate goal was that our project could be used to improve the health and survival of bees. Achieving this goal requires introducing our creation into the environment, and therefore necessitates the consideration of what the wider impacts of our project on living animals and ecosystems might be. In addition to conducting experiments to ensure that neither porphyrin nor E. coli would be harmful to bees, we also had to think about the impact of E. coli and porphyrin beyond the bees we are trying to treat. Our construct was made in Bl21 DE3 E. coli. This is a lab strain, and therefore survives poorly in the wild, and would likely not be able to spread if we introduced it to the hive. Secondly, we had to consider the environmental persistence of porphyrin. Porphyrin is a light-sensitive molecule, and would degrade if it escaped into the environment, but it is able to persist in the dark space of the bee gut. The inability of porphyrin to persist in lit environments negates the need for a kill switch in our system: there is no need to limit porphyrin production to the bee gut, as the molecule will be degraded if produced in a light environment. An alternative approach would be to use our construct in a bioreactor to biosynthetically produce porphyrin. This approach avoids the environmental considerations involved in introducing E. coli into bee hives, and is therefore a valid ethical consideration in trying to minimize potential negative impacts of our project.A large part of our ethical considerations this year involved deciding how to work with bees in a lab setting. We chose to work with live bees because it was the only plausible way to work with Nosema (we talk about this more on our safety page). When working with bees we made sure that we were working within iGEM guidelines. We also connected with experts to gain advice on how best to work with bees. We relied on the expertise of community members like Elizabeth Goldie, Dr. Rassol, and Courtney MacInnis. They answered questions that could not be answered by papers, and gave us ideas on how to care for the bees while we tested on them."

UAlberta,Public Engagement,High School Presentations,"As the end of the iGEM season drew nearer, we wanted to share the results of our project to a community outside of our university. We visited Advanced Placement biology classes at Strathcona High School, a local school from which one of our team members graduated. This was also a perfect opportunity to introduce students to the concept of synthetic biology, and plant the seed of pursuing research and science after high school. We explained the concepts of using DNA as building blocks and bacteria as factories to create useful tools, using our project as an example.We also shared our experiences of working with bees, and what it’s like to be part of a student-led research team. None of the students present had been introduced to iGEM before,  so we were able to present to them for the first time an opportunity that they might want to take part in when they attend university, or even sooner by starting a high school team. Our presentations were an opportunity to encourage high school students to consider taking part in research one day, to share our advice about university life, and to show students the possibilities of what biology and creativity can do outside of what they learn in their classroom.

UC San Diego,Human Practices Silver,Putting the larger questions into context,"As a team, we realized that too often, scientists end up doing “science in a vacuum”, where their technological innovations don’t translate because of real world parameters. To avoid that, our team set out to answer some central questions that our team faced throughout our journey. In particular, our team wanted to rigorously test the design of our project when faced with real world constraints. Through our interactions, we got to explore some of the more salient issues related to social innovation, intellectual property, sustainable, user-centered design, and scalability. Rather than just be passive learners in each of these domains, we took deliberate action in each realm to make a more cohesive project, even including education as a key cornerstone of our activities. "
UC San Diego,Human Practices Silver,How can we gather a holistic perspective about the fundamentals of cancer diagnostics?,"Our team took a stakeholder-focused approach for our project from the beginning, getting clinicians’ perspectives on addressing the root of an important issue in cancer diagnostics. We took the unusual step of using epigenetic determinants as a primary indicator of cancer. To gain a better sense of the overall space and get advice from industry professionals, we talked to several individuals at some of the world’s biggest biotechnology companies such as Roche, Illumina, and Genentech. We also talked to individuals in academia to understand some of the crucial variables that we had to consider when designing and optimizing our genetic circuits. From talking to angel investors and venture capitalists, we also came to realize the importance of the However, it was important to realize that there was a broader picture here, namely the deployment of our innovation in the real world."
UC San Diego,Human Practices Silver,How can we maximize our impact in the communities that we are trying to help?,"Because we were working with hepatocellular carcinoma, we wanted to get a better understanding of the communities that were most impacted by the disease. Literature research showed us that within the United States, Hispanic individuals and individuals of lower socio-economic research were disproportionately impacted by this disease. By reaching out to the Social Innovation Program at UC San Diego and meeting with Ms. Naila Chowdhury, we were able to get a better sense of the challenges in the social innovation sector. Her advice helped us realize that a big challenge of our idea was getting people to put aside their fear of genetically modified organisms and embrace this new treatment method. Especially in the medical world, clinicians often resist change and are slow to adopt new technologies for fear of disruption to the status quo. To gain an understanding of how this plays out on an international stage, we also met with one of the main figures at the world’s largest philanthropic groups, the TATA Board in India to discuss how we could further our impact. They also suggested that (1) education and (2) access to better resources would be the key going forward. As a result, we have done meticulous research to compile a policy brief on improving healthcare in low-resource communities. We also participated in the Global Empowerment Summit where we shared our vision for using synthetic biology to advance cancer diagnostics. In addition, our team focused on building a modular workflow for cancer diagnostics. To this end, the first part of our vision was an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that aids in biomarker discovery. Although our approach was tailored for hepatocellular carcinoma based on the input data, our algorithm is applicable for any disease with documented methylome data. We then harness this in silico tool to guide our design in the wetlab as we can design probes that are complementary to the regions of hypermethylation that we are examining. From there, the digital health platform can be integrated across existing platforms, allowing ease of access and convenience to potential users."
UC San Diego,Human Practices Silver,What factors do we have to consider when implementing our vision in different settings?,"In talking to TIGS, they also pointed us to consider the different use cases: the environment for implementation is very different when it is a clinical researcher in a large, centralized government laboratory compared to a low-resource clinic in a remote region. As a result, they introduced us to the ASSURED criteria, a set of guiding principles that should be considered for clinical implementation of point-of-care devices. This means that they should be affordable, specific and sensitive (both indicators of diagnostic accuracy), user-friendly, robust (rigorously tested in a variety of settings), equipment-free, and deliverable.In designing our microfluidic system, we were able to meet most of these criteria as the rigor of our assay and machine learning system had already been validated. The one factor that we were unable to meet was equipment-free as the methodology and the amplification strategies that we wanted to use required standard laboratory equipment. One of our goals going forward will be to further miniaturize our technology and meet this requirement."
UC San Diego,Human Practices Silver,How do we ensure the safety of our system? Are there any other ethical considerations? ,"Paramount to the success of any clinical test is its diagnostic accuracy and its safety. No clinician will endorse a test that has potential harm, and no patient will want to try such a test. When we also considered the fact that there was a general stigma around GMOs, a faster timeline for wide scale implementation would be possible if we used a cell-free system. Some of the inherent advantages of a cell-free system are that the protein production can be optimized more easily, and it is also easier to control.Another part of our workflow also posed an interesting conundrum. Our team thought there was great promise for the digital health component in our workflow; however, it soon became apparent that data privacy and patient confidentiality is a significant concern in today’s world that hinders early adoption of our workflow. To address these issues, our team did an in-depth analysis of HIPAA regulations and current data standards to make sure that our functional prototype would adhere to these specific standards."
UC San Diego,Human Practices Silver,How can we be better scientists?,"Our team wanted to perform an introspective analysis of our iGEM journey. We realized that in addition to coming up with an amazing project and interacting with such a diverse group of stakeholders, it was important to consider our team’s activities. It was important to foster an inclusive environment; although we all come from different backgrounds with different strengths and weaknesses, it was crucial that we respect one another and try to learn from each other. As several of our team members came from traditionally under-represented groups, we became more aware of the issues of women and LGBTQ+ empowerment in the sciences and came up with a four point engagement plan that we hope future iGEM teams and the iGEM foundation will incorporate into their practices. "
UC San Diego,Human Practices Silver,How can we use education to further advance synthetic biology?,"Lastly, our team knew that large spikes of change are very rare: it is only through incremental improvement and learning from the past that we are able to move forward. As a result, our team designed a very strong platform for education and empowerment of students of all ages and backgrounds, including a cohesive textbook that covers relevant, appealing topics in biology as well as a condensed periodic table of synthetic biology elements as a primer for students who are curious about core elements and principles. Our entire public engagement and outreach initiative can be found on the Public Engagement section of our wiki."
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices,Incorporating a Novel Communication Paradigm for iGEM Teams," As a new team, we looked to past teams who had engaged in stakeholder interactions and Integrated Human Practices to guide our own intuition. Our team quickly realized that often times, other teams simply spoke to other domain experts or end users without having a fully thought-out approach that would allow for integration of advice into project design and deployment. It was also important to realize that a lot of the narratives that teams put forward were extremely linear: the interactions did not invite the team to consider the impact of their decisions or help them optimize their overall design.   In our day-to-day operations, we also experienced the struggles of cross-team discussion. It was quite difficult for people in the wetlab to keep track of what the drylab team was doing, or to keep track of what the entrepreneurship group was trying to deploy. It was also sometimes difficult to ascertain the broad-scale impact of our interactions with certain experts or stakeholders. We were also sure that our team was not the only one to experience such difficulties. To resolve these issues, our team came up with a novel paradigm that we believe will help streamline project issues for future teams.  Similar to the design-build-test cycle that Imperial College introduced in 2006, our team believes that although there is a continuous flow of information and need for integration into the project, we can create three phases for the project with the following methodology.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices,  Recognize ," From the scientific method, something that every elementary school student has learned, it is important to use observations (personal and those of others) to identify problems and then seek solutions. Recognize can be split into two cyclical elements"
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices,Problem Definition , Identify the particular space that you are interested in/ the area that the problem resides and begin to use foundational literature to understand core elements of the problem: Why does it exist? Does the problem differ across different settings? Why is this? 
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, Constraint determination," Although knowing about the problem you are trying to solve is important, it is important to realize that the problem does not exist in a vacuum; it exists because the real world imposes some sort of constraint (technical, environmental, social, etc.) that prevents the solution from being implemented in an ideal manner. Although there are several different types of constraints, as mentioned above, we encouraged ourselves and future teams to first nail down the specific technical constraints that exist. There are several different approaches to constraint determination. Focusing on the values that are important to you as an individual and to your entire time can help guide your decision-making process. 

Stakeholder identification can also dictate who you should talk and about the topic of discussion; a stakeholder is defined as anyone who may be impacted by your activity or may be impacted by someone who is directly impacted by your activity. As a diagnostics team, our challenge was to bridge the gap in communication between engineers and medical professionals: to address this, we spoke with healthcare professionals, synthetic biologists, academia, industry professionals and executives over the course of our project. Our initial interactions focused on the technical challenges of designing our methodology, especially the need for a non-invasive cancer detection technology that did not rely on chemical treatment. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices,  Develop  ," After defining the technical parameters of the project, it is important to consider to see how this actually impacts the solution development aspect of one’s project. Often times, teams already have a pre-conceived notion for the problem space they are trying to address. In order to clear the barriers for innovation, it is of utmost importance that the team begin to shape this unrefined idea after each of the initial stakeholder interactions rather than prior.   Development can also be split into two cyclic elements:  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, Modeling and Visualizations ," Modeling is everyone’s best friend, especially an iGEM team’s because it allows for further characterization of a part, device, or a system before actually using resources to build it. For us, it was important to be able to visualize the development of our solution to make sure it fit into the technical parameters that we had determined beforehand. Diagnostics teams can use modeling to check for the validity of their project via a bottom-top approach: protein modeling and an understanding of Michaelis - Menten kinetics can help provide validity of genetic circuit design; further modeling can characterize an entire system (i.e. if a team is developing components for a microfluidic device), and also provide an ecosystem overview that demonstrates the impact of disease monitoring. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, Genetic Circuit Design ," Although people often think that this step is all about the wetlab scientists and benchwork, it is actually a collaborative endeavor: feedback from earlier modeling and visualization can lead to tweaks or optimizations in the circuit design itself. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices,  Deploy  ," After the validation of the genetic circuit, the next step, especially for teams in Diagnostics, Environment, Food and Energy, and Manufacturing tracks is to develop a strategy for implementation in the real-world. Here, teams should consider the other category of constraints (social, resource-based, financial, etc.). We call these dimensional considerations. By thinking about entrepreneurial considerations or what it will take to implement your solution with minimal resources, teams will help guide the evolution of their project in a more pragmatic direction. One thing to keep in mind is that sometimes talking to these stakeholders may uncover information that changes a foundational assumption and sends you back to the drawing board. It can be disheartening at first, but it is important to use this as a learning lesson and as a pivot for the direction of your project. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, Communication ," Scientists are notoriously ineffective communicators, and this extends to iGEM teams as well. To help resolve this, it is important to identify your audience and determine what their most crucial needs are. Why are you presenting this information to them and what are they hoping to get out of it? The goal of effective communication is to make sure that each party gets something out of it: it is important to make sure that the information given is clearly described without logical missteps and is effectively delivered.  This brings us to our second sub-component of communication: communication through design. Especially as iGEM members, our most effective platform for communicating our results is through the wiki, and too often, too much technical depth is provided. After identifying your target audience(s), it can be difficult to tailor the information specifically through them, but that is where information design can be a very powerful tool. Make sure that your graphics are clean and communicate a single concept at a time; much like good writing, it’s important to allow your reader/viewer the opportunity to digest the information at their own pace and to communicate just what is necessary, nothing more, nothing less.  The beauty of our approach is that all parts are ongoing at all times! We encourage teams to use this paradigm and incorporate it throughout their entire project, and we hope that it will be of great benefit to teams going forward.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, Development of a biomarker discovery tool  ," As a result of this paradigm, we uncovered a critical lag in the development of commercially available liquid biopsy tests. One of the reasons was that scientists and clinicians did not have a centralized methodology for determining biomarkers of interest for specific diseases. Instead, labs would independently identify these markers and then publish papers to communicate their results. Our team believed that because our idea approached cancer diagnostics from a completely new angle and with the development of an uncommon diagnostic metric, it would be important to create a modular biomarker discovery tool that can analyze any existing methylome data and can also integrate existing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, Expansion of our workflow to integrate a digital health platform ," In addition to addressing a core issue in cancer diagnostics, our team’s exploration of the patient care journey led us to identify another significant economic burden on our healthcare system: doctors are unable to ascertain if a treatment has been effective or not long enough because of poor doctor-patient communication. To address this issue, our team developed a functional prototype of a digital health platform. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, Development of novel use cases ," Although clinicians cautioned us that using promoter methylation as a diagnostic indicator could impact the overall accuracy of our test, implementation of novel signal amplification strategies helped address many of these concerns. In addition to implementing our idea as a early screening tool, our interactions with industry professionals and social innovators led us to the realize the value of hypermethylation’s continuous nature. As such, we were able to develop a novel use case centered around post-therapy response.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, UCSD Health System ," We were fortunate enough to be active in the clinical immersion process. Although the names of the patients are covered for confidentiality purposes, we were able to gain an in-depth perspective of a cancer patient’s journey throughout the diagnostics journey. We understood that patient normally  goes through the following stages: prognosis, diagnosis, verification through companion diagnostics, treatment, and post-therapeutic monitoring. The most common method of identifying cancer would be to take a tissue biopsy, and there were a number of issues here for patients: namely the invasiveness and the price point. They also talked about the significant emotional cost that a patient and their family face during this journey. A secondary concern was that a long turnaround time may impede treatment. After talking to several clinicians, they also mentioned that tissue biopsies are not always the best option, as they can spread cancers in certain instances or they might cause further complications. In addition, often times, the first biopsy may result in inconclusive diagnosis, and attempting a second biopsy may present risks. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, Takeaway:," At this point, our team was able to see that the gold standard or “status quo” was clearly not enough in the cancer diagnostics space. There was an issue of invasiveness, price point, and overall accuracy. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Poorya Sabounchi, internal affiliate with Illumina Accelerator  "," Dr. Cashin currently serves as the head of the Illumina Accelerator and Dr. Sabounchi is a startup advocate. Dr. Sabounchi helped answer some of our  key questions about next-generation sequencing technology . In addition to describing the mechanisms of NGS, he also talked about some of the key diagnostic metrics that Illumina and GRAIL, a liquid biopsy startup by Illumina, are currently focusing on. He explained that NGS uses deep sequencing runs in order to identify mutations, perform whole-genome sequencing, and believes that they can identify mutations at a better rate than existing practices.  He also walked us through some of the companies in the Illumina accelerator and how they were able to harness the power of NGS for improving genomics. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices,Takeaway:," Although most of the feedback we got from Dr. Pellini was positive, he did mention that to take our idea to market beyond the scope of iGEM, it would be essential to come up with a pricing framework and a successful business model that leveraged our value propositions. He validated our price point of $250 and gave us most of our current information about the healthcare reimbursement strategies, and also encouraged us to focus on performing some TAM, SAM, and TM calculations. All of these calculations are included in our business plan on the wiki, and we have also attached our pitch deck. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Pranav Singh, Bioinformatics Team, GRAIL "," After speaking with the Illumina Accelerator, we felt that it would be important to understand some of the current alternatives. We reached out to some members of the bioinformatics team at GRAIL to get a better sense of what they do. They first  introduced the idea of liquid biopsy, which is given to the collective procedures that amount to non-invasive cancer detection techniques . We learned that the inherent tumor heterogeneity  and the ability of cancer genomes to evolve are not properly captured by tissue specimens. GRAIL instead  looks at cell-free DNA  that is shed by cells and is trying to develop highly accurate. The team also took some time to explain their day to day operations and explained that bioinformatics is becoming exceedingly important due to the massive amounts of data per patient. They use bioinformatics to derive patterns that can generate further clinical insight or help develop more effective treatments in the future.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Dr. Mikael Eliasson, head of Global Product Development and Strategic Innovation "," A subsequent conversation with Dr. Eliasson focused on more acutely addressing our primary stakeholders’ needs. Based on prior confirmations and confirmation from both patient and healthcare professionals, we had identified another critical lag in the traditional diagnostics journey. In post-therapy monitoring, there is often a significant decrease in communication between the doctors and patients, and  this lack of post-treatment symptoms reporting can be crucial in judging if the treatment was successful. We wanted to address this, and based on the trends of digital health, our team had the  idea to develop a digital health platform . Talking to Dr. Eliasson helped us understand the key components, especially personalization and the ability to give actionable information for both the healthcare professional and the patient.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Amogha Tadimety, pHD student at the Thayer School of Engineering "," After performing further literature review, we came across a paper that detailed some of the prevalent methods of analysis for the liquid biopsy space. We contacted the primary author of the paper, Amogha Tadimety, who was a pHD student writing a thesis in a focus area similar to ours. She explained that there has been a recent push to expand liquid biopsy technologies into clinical settings and point-of-care settings.  She walked us through the biosensor design, explaining that a biosensor is a device that take a a biological material and puts it in contact with a  recognition element to capture an analyte and a transduction element to allow for a measurable signa  l. She cautioned us to focus on  choosing a suitable medium of analysis , including circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and exosomes.  From this, we learned that circulating tumor DNA was probably a good idea for our project. This is partially because circulating tumor DNA provides effective tumor genome profiles and can be sampled non-invasively and subsequently analyzed for specific metrics. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Dr. Kang Zhang, Shiley Eye Institute and UCSD School of Medicine "," Our second meeting with Dr. Zhang focused on deciding which cancer to focus on. Our team had narrowed down our choices to breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Dr. Zhang expressed interest in both, but said that identifying methylation markers in breast cancer could be quite difficult; his lab had been examining the problem, and found that the vast majority of putative markers often overlapped with uterine cancer and ovarian cancer, so this would be difficult given the time constraints. When we brought up the idea of identifying pan-cancer markers, he told us that although this was a good idea, it would not be very useful in diagnostics because the amount of clinical insight that could be generated would be very limited and researchers would be unable to synthesize a specific treatment. Instead, he confirmed that we should go forward with working on a single proof-of-concept disease and then broadening our focus towards other diseases as well. While  he encouraged us to identify markers specific to hepatocellular carcinoma , he also pointed us to some foundational literature and lab documentation to guide our decision making.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices,Takeaway: ," This conversation primarily helped confirm that we were on the right track with our intuition about how the navigate the space around epigenetic-based liquid biopsy. It helped us understand some of the concerns about intellectual property. We also decided that in the wetlab, following the successful testing of our baseline circuit, we would need to develop some signal amplification strategies. Following this, we met with Parth Majmudar at the UCSD Office of Innovation and Commercialization who helped walk us through the process. Prior to the Jamboree, the team has filed for a provisional patent. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Harry Gandhi, founder at Medella Health "," Our conversation with Harry was centered around understanding the intricacies of  smartphone diagnostics. One of the key concerns that patients expressed when approached about the idea of using smartphone applications as platforms for personalized medicine and health tracking was the possibility that confidential medical data would be released. In addition, he also wanted us to focus on having a clean design for the actual interface and try to address as many pain points for HCPs and patients as possible. Although Harry is more involved in the technical deployment of the sensors, he was still able to provide guidance about the security protocols . We had a robust discussion about the importance of complying with HIPPAA regulations as well as the GDPR rules recently passed by the EU. He appreciated the novelty of our vision and looked forward to seeing a prototype. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Amogha Tadimety, pHD student at Thayer School of Engineering "," After designing our baseline circuit and fleshing out some of our wetlab plans, we had a second discussion with Amogha. She helped  validate our planned circuit methodology . Because she has extensive knowledge about liquid biopsy applications in a clinical setting as well in point-of-care devices, we asked her about what to consider for the different use cases. Our initial instinct was that we wanted to implement this as a point-of-care device because we believed that is where it would have its greatest impact, but she explained that it would be  better to first focus on a workflow for a clinical methodology  that met clinicians’ needs before moving on to the next use case. She re-emphasized that we should  focus on the sensitivity and the specificity  because administering it in point-of-care would inevitably have lower accuracy to lack of high-quality instrumentation. She suggested that we have try strategies for implementation that would allow for sample DNA amplification or increased sensitivity. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, Takeaway:  ," As a result, we engineered a second genetic circuit that relied on multimerized tandem-MBD proteins, which literature suggested have a higher binding affinity. We also agreed that it would be prudent to develop a MBD-based circuit and methodology for the clinical setting before expanding our use cases.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Dr. Ludmil Alexandrov, Bioengineering at UCSD, Moores Cancer Research Center "," Although not directly related to work with epigenetics. Dr. Alexandrov is known for developing Alexandrov signatures, which are mutational signatures that serve as cancer indicators. He is also currently the head of an international project that is developing a comprehensive map of mutational signatures. He expressed great interest in our project and thought that it holds great promise. Although he was a little worried about the rigorous timeline for the project and the iGEM competition, he felt that  advancing the use of epigenetic determinants as a cancer indicator  was an important step and could have several ramifications down the road. Several factors that he thought we should consider included the capability for high-throughput analysis. Whether it be in a clinical setting or out in the field,  it is always better to carry out multiplexed analysis . He also emphasized that for maximum approach, our workflow should be modular and that our circuit should be used for multiple types of cancer.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Nina Vandeventer, Global Head of Personalized Development at Genentech  "," In talking to Ms. Vandeventer, we learned more about the  broader challenges in implementing a diagnostic test in a clinical setting . She re-iterated a crucial point that we had heard many times: the key to getting healthcare professionals and healthcare providers would be to demonstrate high levels of accuracy . She also suggested in order to improve our overall design, we need to  discuss our perspectives with as many stakeholders as possible . In her position at Roche/Genentech, interacting with stakeholders is essential to understanding expectations, needs, and concerns. By embedding their feedback int our strategy and our implementation, we would be able to develop a sustainable solution that addresses the needs of more people. Important stakeholder groups included patients, healthcare professionals, providers, and the scientific community. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Dr. Michael Pellini, Section 32 and Former CEO of Foundation Medicine "," Our team was lucky enough to have a sit-down meeting with the venture capital fund Section 32 in San Diego and meet with Dr. Pellini, who provided some great insight. Dr. Pellini has been in the diagnostics space for over 20 years, and he was able to validate much of our foundational understanding. As with most of our interactions, we were told that the  key bottleneck for development and implementation of liquid biopsy tests was the lack of strong predictive value  in order to be of use to clinicians. He also thought that at this point, it would be a good idea to give  some forethought for our intellectual property strategy  . Because we were going to disclose a lot of our research through our wiki and presentation at the Giant Jamboree, he felt that filing a provisional patent would be an important component of defining our differentiating core. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Dr. Tina He, post-doctoral scholar at the Zhang Lab  "," One of our shifts in the wetlab was to add steps that would enhance the diagnostic power of our assay. In addition, one of the problems that we had run into after over-expressing the MBD protein was that the protein would detect hypermethylation across the entire body of the sample, just not the promoter region as we wanted. Thus, we needed to address the non-specificity of the MBD and derive a quantitative readout. To do this,  our team implemented a graphene oxide platform, and used its properties of affinity to single-stranded DNA and fluorescence quenching to give the specificity needed. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Dr. Jason Kreisberg, Research Scientist at the Ideker Lab  "," Dr. Kreisberg is part of the Cancer Cell Map Initiative, a joint collaboration between UC San Diego and UC San Francisco. In talking with him and several members of his lab, we were able to  validate the framework  that we put forward. They gave us a lot of technical considerations: including the ability of our protocols to differentiate between cell-free DNA and circulating tumor DNA. They also wondered how we would amplify the signal to noise ratio in the readout itself. They also emphasized that a diagnostic test alone has limited utility, but we need to be able to  generate additional clinical insight from that data . Dr. Kreisberg’s team also emphasized that in order to improve overall accuracy for a test implemented in a clinical setting, we would benefit from a workflow with reduced complexity.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Dr. Douglas Densmore, Boston University  "," After these discussions, our team realized that we did not have enough experience in working with microfluidics. Thus, we turned to Boston University for a collaboration because their hardware team was working with microfluidics. In talking to Dr. Densmore, we first explained the general framework of our idea. He then explained that there were several classes of microfluidic devices, including paper, controlled flow, and droplet-based microfluidics.  He gave the advantages and disadvantages of each classification , and suggested for our use case,  it would make sense to consider controlled flow  . He also explained that if we were to go in a point of care direction, it would make more sense for paper microfluidics but those are typically one-step based and not as accurate as controlled flow which is designed with precision through AutoCAD and soft lithography techniques using materials such as PDMS. He also explained some of the work that he does at the CIDAR lab, which develops broad-use tools for microfluidic chip design and fabrication.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices,Takeaway :,"  Our team decided that for the most part, we would focus on the implementation and verification of the genetic circuit, and worry about microfluidic integration towards the end. We also decided that a controlled flow microfluidic device would make most sense for our use case. We also launched contact with the Boston University iGEM team and had a video call to discuss our overall idea. They helped us iron out some of the challenges for using microfluidic devices in cancer diagnostics, and we kept this in mind for our design. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices, UCSD Biodynamics Lab ," After selecting controlled flow devices as our primary interest, we met with several undergraduate and graduate researchers at the UCSD Biodynamics Lab, run by Dr. Jeff Hasty. Our conversations helped us realize that their are several  key parameters to keep in mind for developing a mathematical representation of a microfluidic system  . Because the laws of physics remain the same in microscopic and macroscopic systems but gives rise to different forces, we must consider how reduction of size has an influence of the characteristic times of the system. They also explained that , integrating microfluidic devices with synthetic biology can also have a number of benefits: faster response times, formation of static and dynamic gradients at sub cellular resolution.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Naila Chowdhury, Director of Social Innovation, and Dr. Suresh Subramani, TIGS "," As part of our exploratory process, we also wanted to consider the larger questions and take into context the broader impact of what we were doing. We reached out to the director of Social Innovation, Ms. Naila Chowdhury, and explained the overall workflow. She expressed great interest and enthusiasm in our project, and helped affirm that through her work, she saw the utility of a cost-effective liquid biopsy test for hepatocellular carcinoma, especially because of its disproportional impact on the Hispanic population in the US with increasing rates of diagnosis, as well as its prevalence in South and Southeast Asia. She also introduced us to Dr. Suresh Subramani, the former vice-chancellor who expressed similar enthusiasm for our project. He helped us consider how we could potentially implement our idea on an international scale. As one of the presiding members of the TATA Institute of Genetics and Society, he was able to connect us to a number of other researchers who helped us understand the implications of applying our solution in low-resource settings. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Dr. Jian Dai, Senior Data Scientist for Personalized Health Care at Genentech "," Part of our needs-finding had uncovered a critical lag in the development of liquid biopsy tests.  Researchers and clinicians were unsure of which biomarkers to analyze for different diseases. Our team wanted to take the step of addressing this crucial gap in existing liquid biopsy workflows. Talking to Dr. Dai helped give us additional perspective in the drylab, and gave us awareness of the tools that are needed for data analysis. After talking to Dr. Dai, our team was able to come up with a  methodology for an unsupervised machine learning framework   that would aid in biomarker discovery. By using techniques such as Random Forest and Lasso-Cox, we would be able to discover the optimal gene panel combinations to detect promoter methylation across a subset of patients based on the disease of interest.  "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," BLUE LINC, Biodesign Incubator at UC San Diego  "," We were also fortunate to meet and discuss some of the technical issues with some graduate students and faculty at the medical school by talking with BLUE LINC, an on-campus resource modeled after the Stanford Biodesign process. Several members of the cohort were able to provide their expertise with the process of medical device design and innovation. They were impressed with the thoroughness of our approach, but encouraged us to think more about the regulatory obstacles that could hamper our ability to bring this product to market. Because laboratory testing of a potential clinical test is of vital importance, we would have to comply with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA). Before we can test human samples for diagnostic testing, we must demonstrate the rigor of our approach and get a waiver from the CDC and FDA. For some members of the cohort, a larger concern that they had picked up on through their clinical immersion was  the integration of our clinical test into existing routines . They explained that individuals are less likely to be early adopters, especially for medical devices, if it places too much of a burden. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Manoj Kumar, TATA Board Trustee and CEO of Social Alpha "," Building on our earlier interactions, Dr. Subramani put us in contact with one of his contacts in the TATA Board, Mr. Manoj Kumar, who oversees a $75 million grant to UCSD that is focused on advancing disease detection. He shared his vision for Social Alpha, a social innovation ecosystem centered in India that addresses some of the larger challenges that a developing nation faces. We were given an opportunity to discuss our idea with him, and he affirmed that an HCC liquid biopsy test would be helpful in low-resource communities . Talking with several portfolio managers at Social Alpha helped give insight into the challenges of entering the Indian market, and they also reiterated that it would be important to make sure that this would be available at a reasonable price point. The Indian healthcare system is not as robust as the American one, and there are far fewer localized hospitals; instead, most medical analysis happens at large, centralized government labs. They saw great value in the digital health platform as the Indian government has recently embraced the “digital era” and are  pushing forward with a grant of $100,000 to support our research going forward. "
UC San Diego,Integrated Human Practices," Dr. Mike Pellini, Section 32 and Former CEO of Foundation Medicine "," In order to get a thorough assessment of our clinical and financial validity, we turned to Dr. Mike Pellini, a venture capitalist here in San Diego. We had the chance to sit down with him and give an informal pitch that laid out the existing problems in cancer diagnostics and bottlenecks in liquid biopsy and how our innovation in the lab directly addressed those concerns.  He appreciated the modularity of our approach, telling us that as a potential investor, his primary concern would be the ability to enter adjacent markets . Because he is an investor in Freenome, which would be our most significant competition in the space, he was able to answer some of the deeper questions about liquid biopsy and the direction of the industry.  He also really appreciated the stakeholder-focused approach that we took, and eventually provided us with his personal testimony, which we have included in the Entrepreneurship section and landing page of the wiki.  "
UC San Diego,Education and Public Engagement,Global Empowerment Summit,"People: This particular activity actually spun out of our Integrated Human Practices. After realizing the vast potential of our liquid biopsy test and its impact as a tool in social innovation, we were invited to present our vision for improving cancer diagnostics at the Global Empowerment Summit at UC San Diego. We were able to impact a demographic that we hadn’t even considered: namely social innovators and entrepreneurs.Design and Dialogue: After talking to Ms. Naila Chowdhury, it became apparent that our project had potential to make a positive difference for at-risk populations with limited access to medical care, and therefore was of significant interest to social entrepreneurs. We also realized that although these individuals had a reason to be interested in our project (and in synthetic biology as a whole), they also had an extremely diverse set of knowledge bases that did not necessarily overlap with the basic science behind our project.  In preparing for the Global Empowerment Summit, we learned that many of the guest lecturers and attendees had significant education and experience in business, communications, and management; very few had much exposure to biology beyond college, and none would be fully apprised of the recent developments in synthetic biology. In preparation for the summit, we kept our audience in mind. We knew that it was important to explain our project step-by-step, to use frequent comparisons to real-world products, and to tie each step back to the element of our project that was of the most interest; its potential for social good. We designed a poster and slideshow presentation that was accurate but simplified to this end. Unlike our other projects for EPE, we were targeting an older audience, and therefore kept in mind to explain our project at the level of most basic biological elements; well-known and easily recognizable terms like “DNA”, “genetic code”, and “proteins” were used to slowly explain the higher-level concepts such as “hypermethylation” and “biomarkers”. At the summit, we were able to communicate our vision for how synthetic biology can solve everyday problems and how we were using synthetic biology to improve diagnostics with over 300 people. Reflection: We learned in this process that the most effective way to engage this population was almost exclusively through one-on-one dialogue with interested individuals. Though our poster and slideshow generated some interest, our best conversations and interactions came when the people we talked to had our individual attention, and had time to ask pertinent questions and become acquainted with our project at their own pace. This was also the most effective space in which to communicate the real world impact that we hope our product could have. It was far easier to relate our project science with our project goals verbally. In light of this, we focused more on one-on-one interactions when we had other opportunities to present to highly-educated non-experts."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Overview,"  For the human practices, we have two main goals. One is to improve our own project. Another is to promote us, iGEM and synthetic biology to the public. Our integrated Human Practices will mainly talk about how HP affects the project. And in our Education& Public Engagement, you will find more about how we let people engage synthetic biology."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Integrated HP,"  At the beginning of the competition, we decided to construct the integrated biobrick database. Because of the specialty of the project, our main users will be iGEMers and synthetic biologists. Then we thought carefully about how to make sure our project would work well and meet the needs of those who conduct synthetic biological experiments. So, we created a complete ‘investigation-improve-test-feedback’ framework with 7 steps and 2 rounds of tests and feedback to improve our project. Then we did our human practices in correspondence to every step of this circle.  Here’s the 7-step circle. You can click the fellow bottons to straightly see any step you want to know or you can read it step by step."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Problems and Idea,"  First, we encountered the problems when using iGEM Registry to conduct experiments and we came up with the idea of constructing this BioMaster database to solve the problem."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Preliminary Investigation,"  Then, preliminary investigation is essential which will be our directions for the first construction. We did some surveys and questionnaires for nearly 100 participated iGEMers or professors about the problems they met when doing synthetic biological experiments. Of course, we analyzed what we investigated. What’s more, not only online research but we communicated with different teams face to face for their opinions and their needs for a new biobrick database. Also, we consulted a lawyer for the rights of using other databases in case we violated some regulations. "
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Questionnaires and Analysis,"  Before the start of our project, we need to know clearly what problems we are facing and what our users’ needs are. Only in this way will we make sure that our project is adaptable and user-friendly. We designed an online questionnaire ‘Investigation of situation about the use of iGEM parts’ and spread it to over 16 districts and nearly 100 iGEMers and synthetic biologists.   Of course, questionnaire cannot live without analysis. We spent some time analyzing the results and used the method of binary-crossover analysis. Surprised results were found and it inspired us for the next step."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,A visit with iGEM team,"  We went to UESTC-China and communicated with them about their opinions. First, we asked the problems they may want to avoid and what they think is a user-friendly database. Their opinions are important for us to design the database."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Consulting the lawyer and Our statement,"  Considered that BioMaster may involve with intellectual property issues and issues for users, we deliberately visited Mr. Zheng Yonggang, Senior Partner and Director of Sichuan Shangsheng Law Firm who has handled many related events and has rich experience in this field. He indicated that since these databases are open resources and there’s no confirmation on these databases that we are able to use it. No intellectual property issues are involved. We checked carefully on every database we integrated to avoid any missing possible regulation on the property of database. At the same time, we made a statement mentioned clearly what we integrated and we have no commercial intentions.
                        "
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Conversation with lawyer,"Question1: Does BioMaster cause any infringement when using data and providing links to related documents from other databases?Answer: If related resources are open to everyone and there’s no statement, using related data will be fully reasonable and legal. What’s more, BioMaster only provides references and the original links which is open on the related websites. So there will be no infringement.Question 2: If users cause some influences on the project or others via using data in BioMaster, is BioMaster responsible for it? Answer: Since the software is free and there is no interest dispute between the two parties. Users should use the voluntary principle when using it. Therefore, even if there are adverse consequences, the software provider is not responsible."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,0 Version Start!,"  With the investigation and analysis, we merged it with our idea and we started our 0 version so that what we constructed would better fit user’s needs. "
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Professional Advice,"  When the 0 version was done, what we need was more professional and authoritative suggestions. To make sure the comprehension of the suggestions, not only universities but institutes and bio-technology company were visited. They gave us very specific suggestions and what we should improve. At the same time, we gained experience on establishing the database. "
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Communication with Dr. Dai,"  On 31st Jul, we attended the scholars' forum on synthetic biology, led by Dr. Dai Junbiao from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. After the forum, we communicated with Dr. Dai. We simply introduced what BioMaster is and what we want to achieve. He gave us his opinions and what he think about our projects. Also, he provided something that we should improve such as experimented data."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Talking with Gene Technology company and Professor in NUDT,"  On 3rd Aug, our members went to Chengdu life baseline technology co. LTD and interviewed engineers who is working on a database. They gave us useful suggestions on the optimizing of details. One of the engineers shared his experiences on the construction of database.  At CCiC, we had honor to get acquaintance to Professor Zhu in NUDT. He encouraged us to keep working on our database and he suggested that we should classify the biobricks by species."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,5th CCiC and Southwestern Union,"  We took part in 2 big conferences in China held for iGEMers to share experiences and communicated with each other. In the meantime, it’s a good chance to be acquainted with iGEM teams and collaborated with them.  The 5th CCiC was held in ShanghaiTech University with over 500 people participated. On this conference, we gained valuable advice and we first brought our project and many teams gave us their suggestions.  Southwestern Union was established for many universities in southwestern of China. Not only universities, but high school teams joined in it. "
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Improve,"  After second round collection of suggestions, we improved our project and our interval test version was finished."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Internal test & Feedbacks,"  We sent our internal test version to many iGEM teams and doctors and they gave us their feedback of using it. These feedbacks will be the supportive advice for further improvement. Meanwhile, we noted that some teams encountered some difficulties in finding the data they need. Therefore, our database helped them find it more easily. Via emails, questionnaires or WeChat, we received several feedbacks from iGEM teams or experts."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Final Release,"  With all the the feedbacks and adjustment, our final 1.0 version of BioMaster was borned. To promote it, we held a little release in our university with over 80 undergraduates attended. Simultaneously, we did a live show on the hottest live platform “Douyu” with more than 1600 people watching and comments."
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Silver,"  We chose questionnaires and analysis to get to know users’ needs for a new biobrick database. And we communicated with experts and professors for the professional suggestions on our projects. Also, to make sure that we will not violate any regulations related intellectual property issues. "
UESTC-Software,Human Practice,Contact Us,"uestcsoftware@vip.qq.comNO.2006.XiYuan Avenue,UESTC,Chengdu,China"
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,Overview,"  For the public, the biggest problem of promoting iGEM and synthetic biology is that they never heard of it before and it’s not an easily-understandable field for the public. To promote us in a more interesting and efficient way, we divided the public into 3 groups—Public, Children and Pre-iGEMers (High school students and Undergraduates). We have different positions for each of the groups and adapted different methods to let people all engage in synthetic biology and iGEM. Public—Engage while playing （Bio-Chess）Children—Stimulating interests (iGEM Day)Pre-iGEMers—Propaganda (1st iGEM Festival in UESTC)"
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,Design,"  People spend more and more leisure time on the game, including physical games and online games. We believe that if we can implant scientific knowledge and ideas in the game, people can learn the knowledge of the fields that they may not access in daily life while playing the game. This is more effective than letting people read those boring professional books.  To promote synthetic biology, we designed a board game named Bio-Chess, and produced it both in physical and PC version. It is inspired by the well-known game Monopoly and flying chess. We integrate the idea of genetic engineering into the game, combining this game with synthetic biology knowledge, making players familiar with the process of genetic engineering while experiencing the game.Let us have fun in Bio-Chess!"
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,PC version:,"  In order to better promoting our game, making people who may not be able to experience physical chess can experience the fun of Bio-Chess, we also made a PC version of Bio-Chess. In the PC version of Bio-Chess, we made some minor adjustments to the rules, but this did not affect the synthetic biology thoughts and fun contained in it. The Bio-Chess PC version has been released to the online platform so that the public can easily download to play. Click to Download Bio-Chess for PC."
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,Promotion,"  Bio-Chess debuted at CCiC (Conference of Chinese iGEM Community). We introduced the Bio-Chess to the audience and judges at the Panel Session and received wide acclaim. At the first iGEM Festival in University of Electronic Science and Technology, we combine Bio-Chess with our carefully designed synbio quiz game. Participants need to complete two consecutive sessions where they have a deeper understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology."
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,Future,"  We will continue to promote our Bio-Chess through social media, whether online or offline. And improve it based on feedback from players. In addition, we also hope to cooperate with educational institutions to use our chess as a tool to assist in teaching and to show   its greater value. We believe that our work can really affect the people around us and make them pay more attention to synthetic biology."
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,iGEM Day ‘Gene Go’,"  Of course, it’s hard to let children understand synthetic biology but cultivating their interest is important. We teamed up with Sichuan Science and Technology Museum and UESTC-China and organized a ‘Gene Go’ iGEM Day to provide a good opportunity for children to know iGEM. This iGEM Day was so welcomed by children that after the event was released on the online platform of the Sichuan Science and Technology Museum, we received applications from more than 350 families from the registration channel on the first day. At the show case, the number of parents and children who came to the event exceeded 1,000, and everyone was very enthusiastic. "
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,A series of activities,"  We designed a series of activities such as leaf bookmark making, cell structure fabrication, gene card playing and microscope observation to allow children to participated on their own. During bookmark period, the children showed great enthusiasm and had a great time. Parents were attracted by this fun activity and made leaf bookmarks with their children. After the explanation, the iGEM team members took out the plasticine of various colors and patiently taught the children to make ""organelles"". In the process, the children have a clear understanding of the structure of the cells. After the children made the cells with plasticine, we took the children to observe the real cells with a microscope. The children observed a variety of sliced cells and adjusted the microscope with their own hands. After having fun with real instruments, children’s interest in biology is even stronger. The children understood the tools and approximate processes required for synthetic biology in the gene card game and expressed their strong interest in synthetic biology. "
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,“Cellulose Go”,"  We organized a vivid children stage show “Cellulose Go”. The story is based on the project of UESTC-China and introduces the relationship between cellulose and lignin and the purpose of their project. After the performance, the host asked the children different questions bases on the drama. The children raised their hands and answered, and a little girl could even accurately tell our lines. Through the wonderful performances and simple explanations of the actors, the children not only gained happiness, but also increased their biological knowledge."
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,1st iGEM Festival in UESTC,"  For the pre-iGEMers which is high school students and undergraduates, they’ve already acquired some knowledge of synthetic biology and have heard of iGEM. What we should do is to introduce more details to them and invite them to join us. So we decided to held the 1st iGEM Festival in UESTC and designed two parts, one is game stage and the other is iGEM introduction."
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,Game stage,"  We designed 2 games with the combination of iGEM and synthetic biology. We used our board game Bio-Chess and iGEM Q&A to make students get to know us in a more fun and comprehensive way. Only those who wins the Bio-Chess will have a chance to join in the Q&A part. And the quiz part is also based on the chess procedure. Through these games, students know more about iGEM and synthetic biology. They said that it was of great fun and the designing of Bio-Chess is unexpected and brilliant."
UESTC-Software,Public_Engagement,iGEM Introduction,"  On the introduction, we told the pre-iGEMers what is synthetic biology and iGEM. Through introduction, they got to know iGEM in a more specific way. Different from what they searched on the internet, we told them what we would do for the competition and what we would gain in joining this. After the introduction, high school students and undergraduates showed their great interests in it and asked many questions about what they should do and prepare for iGEM. And we also did a live show on the hottest platform in China with over 1300 people watching."

UiOslo Norway,Human Practices,Human Practices,"One of the silver requirements for the iGEM competition is to incorporate human practices into the project. This is done by careful and creative evaluation of whether the project is responsible and will bring good to the world. We therefore gathered information from experts in their respective fields, which provided new perspectives and valuable insight."
UiOslo Norway,Human Practices,National Reference Laboratory for Medical Mycology,"After we decided to work with yeast, we visited a mycology lab. There we got information on how to properly work with fungi. Three of our team members had the unique opportunity to get a guided tour through the National Reference Laboratory for Medical Mycology at the Oslo University Hospital. The lab is responsible for testing if the patient samples contain microorganisms that are resistant to different types of antimicrobials.One of the creations of the mycology lab, a petri-dish wishing us a ""good summer""So what did we do in the lab? First, we inspected some fungi from patient probes grown on agar plates (amongst others Candida albicans (C. albicans)). Additionally, we attempted to evaluate with which fungus the patient is most probably infected by dint of tables. We started a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test of a patient’s sample. This procedure helps to identify the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial needed to prevent visible growth of a bacterium or a fungus. Lonny (senior researcher) selected some of the most fascinating fungi and we could have a look at them through the microscope. At the end of the day we had a conversation with Lonny about our project idea. She believes that our detection kit would be very precious in a time where antimicrobial resistance is on the rise. From her point of view the possibility to buy antimycotics over-the-counter is a big mistake. She underlined the importance of our project in trying to decrease the over-usage of antimycotics. Following this feedback, we decided to interview more experts in the field of C. albicans infections.All in all this was a very informative and interesting day. Thanks to the National Reference Laboratory for Medical Mycology for giving us an insight into their work."
UiOslo Norway,Human Practices,Interview with experts  ,"With our project we want to approach the problem of misdiagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis. A misdiagnosis can often lead to incorrect treatment. Consequently, there is an overuse of antimycotics which results in antimycotic resistance. In Norway, only 30 % of those who purchase over-the-counter antimycotics actually have an ongoing yeast infection [A]. Our aim for human practices was to find out if women are educated about commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora and genital hygiene. We were also curious about the opinion of pharmacists in matters of antimycotics that are sold over-the-counter.In order to obtain information about these topics, we performed interviews with different experts."

UiOslo Norway,Human Practices,Questionnaire for masters students,"We handed out a short questionnaire to masters students to gather information for our project. We wanted to know if the students knew what Candida albicans is, as well as which steps they were most likely to take to treat a hypothetical infection.Gender and age distribution of respondentsQuestion: Do you know what C. albicans is?The evaluation shows that more than half of the participants did not have prior knowledge of C. albicans, with a higher percentage of men not knowing about C. albicans. This is not surprising, as yeast infections are less common for men. Question: Did you know that C. albicans is a frequent cause of vaginal infections?About 2/3 of the participants didn’t know that C. albicans is a causative of vaginal infection. Most people does not know which pathogen is the cause of the infection, but might still have knowledge of the symptoms.Question: If you have the suspicion of suffering from a vaginal C. albicans infection, would you use a “home-testing kit” in order to obtain a more targeted treatment (1 being not likely and 5 being very likely)?The answers were as expected very widespread. As we can see from the results, women are more open to self-testing with a kit than men are.In conclusion, general knowledge of C. albicans was poor in our sample group. This lead us to spend more time educating and engaging with our community. Additionally, we had to process the information from our interviews with experts. Read more on how we did this on  Integrated Human Practices."
UiOslo Norway,Integrated Human Practices,Integrated Human Practices,"A gold medal criteria for iGEM is not only engaging with the community, but integrating their feedback to change our project for the better. New perspectives and expert feedback helped us think outside the box, and reconsider our previous decisions and approaches."
UiOslo Norway,Integrated Human Practices,Motivation from experts,"We talked with Physicians, Pharmacists, and consulted with Literature. The interviews can be read in full at our Human Practices page.“It is estimated that worldwide around 75 % of women acquire a Candida albicans (C. albicans) infection at least once, and 40-45 % experience two or more episodes.”(Sobel, J.D., Vulvovaginal candidosis. The Lancet, 2007. 369(9577): p. 1961-1971. Hurley, R. and J. de Louvois, Candida vaginitis. Postgraduate Medical Journal, 1979. 55(647): p. 645)Dr. med. Franke, gynecologist, Germany“During a normal work day, I diagnose at least two C. albicans infections.”After interviewing experts and consulting with literature, we were assured that vulvovaginal candidiasis is a widespread problem.Möhringer, general practitioner, Germany“I’m diagnosing C. albicans infections solely through the symptoms of the patient like itching, burning, potentially discharge.” PD Dr., Dr. med. Grunewald, dermatologist, Germany “After examination of the patient I perform a pap test and grow the sample on Sabouraud Agar.”Sex og Samfunn, Norway“At Sex og Samfunn (Sex and Society, free clinic in Oslo), we would in most cases diagnose C. albicans by looking at the discharge under a microscope and look for fungal hyphae. If we do not observe any fungal hyphae, but the patient experience typical fungal infection symptoms, we recommend her to try an antifungal product to see if it helps. If the symptoms are chronic and she has earlier tried an antifungal product that did not relieve the symptoms, it happens that we take a sample from the patient and grow it for further inspection.” After interviewing several physicians with different backgrounds, ranging from gynecologists to dermatologists to general practitioners, we observed that doctors have different approaches on how to diagnose a vulvovaginal C. albicans infection.  A test-kit could provide diagnostic support, allowing for easy detection of C. albicans overgrowth. ""Women suffering from a vaginal C. albicans infection must either go to the doctor for diagnosis or self-treat by purchasing antimycotics over the counter without a prescription. Only 30 % of all women who self-treat in Norway had an actual C. albicans infection”  (http://www.antibiotikaiallmennpraksis.no/index.php?action=showtopic&topic=DrmsfZGV 22.08.2018)Margrethe K. Kristiansen, Pharmacist, Norway“I would estimate that about 9/10 times I sell antimycotics against C. albicans infections to women that were not at physician before going to the pharmacy store.”Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem that is constantly increasing. Unspecific treatment, like buying over-the-counter antimycotics for treating a non-existing C. albicans infection is further reinforcing this issue. Our team agreed on tackling the high number of vulvovaginal candidiasis misdiagnoses.Aina Kristin Pham, Pharmacist, Norway“I don’t know any test for detecting vaginal C. albicans infections. I don’t think pharmacy stores are selling them.”Anita Binder, Pharmacist, Germany“I know Canetest. It is a pH dependent test to distinguish between bacterial vaginosis and thrush. But I have never sold one. I think this is due to missing education and advertisement.”Alexandra Möhringer, general practitioner, Germany“I really like the idea of an easy-to-use test for detecting C. albicans since this would lead to a more targeted and therefore better therapy. But I would like the test to be done at a practitioner, so that in case of a C. albicans infection the physician could prescribe the right antimycotics.”Dr. med. Bastian Czogalla, gynecologist, Germany“In my opinion a test would be very meaningful. My personal idea would be that if a person is treated with antibiotics (for example for treating a bladder infection) the test could be sold together with the antibiotics, since the risk is very high that the women will get a fungal infection due to overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms.”The idea of a kit which can be performed by a physician or a pharmacist sounded promising. This could not only reduce the amount of misdiagnosed cases, but also aid in reducing the unnecessary use of antimycotics."
UiOslo Norway,Integrated Human Practices,Conclusion," The outcome of the questionnaire and the interviews with several experts was the crucial factor for us to start planning an educational campaign. We want to raise awareness and remove the stigma on vaginal health - lack of information, taboo subjects and an increasing amount of body pressure further reinforces this issue. For this purpose we drafted a flyer where women can get information concerning the normal vaginal flora.Click the image to see our flyerDISCLAIMER: This flyer does not constitute medical advice, and is for educational purposes only. We do not take any responsibility in ensuring that the information is correct. If you have any medical issues, should consult with your doctor."
UiOslo Norway,Integrated Human Practices,Further considerations,"In order to assess the acceptance of the test, we conducted a survey using a questionnaire, which we wrote about in Human Practices. The participants were new master students at the Institute for Biosciences at the University of Oslo. Question: If you have the suspicion of suffering from a vaginal C. albicans infection, would you use a “home-testing kit” in order to obtain a more targeted treatment (1 being not likely and 5 being very likely)?The answers were as expected very widespread. The reason for that could be, that people are not well informed about vaginal infections, especially with the fungus C. albicans. That is why we added some general questions about vaginal C. albicans infections to the questionnaire:Question: Did you know what C. albicans is before the presentation?The evaluation shows that more than half of the participants did not have prior knowledge of C. albicans, with a higher percentage of men not knowing about C. albicans. Question: Did you know that C. albicans is a frequent cause of vaginal infections?The evaluation of the questionnaire showed that the participants were not well informed about C. albicans. Therefore, we wondered if women are educated about the normal vaginal flora and also proper genital hygiene.Dr. med. Franke, gynecologist, Germany“I experienced that women are in general poorly educated about commensal microorganisms in the vaginal flora and the knowledge about good hygiene of the genital area is even worse. I could observe that people living in the city are commonly poorly informed whereupon women living on the countryside are even worse educated. In my opinion there is a big need of a campaign that should brief women about these topics.”PD Dr., Dr. med. Susanne Grunewald, dermatologist, Germany“No, I don’t think that women are well informed about these topics. Very often, we as physicians have to educate women about intimate care. In my opinion it would be a good idea to start a campaign for informing women about health of the genital area.”PS: The interviews can be read in full at our Human Practices page."
UiOslo Norway,Education & Engagement,Education & Engagement,"One of the components of the Human Practices is Education and Public Engagement. Here we are going to show you how we engaged and educated both scientists and the public about the synthetic biology. In our case, how we employed synthetic biology to create a precise diagnostic method that could prevent further spread of antimycotic resistance."
UiOslo Norway,Education & Engagement,Presentation for new master students,"At the beginning of the academic year, three members from our team held a presentation for the new master students at the Institute for Biosciences at the University of Oslo. The presentation contained information about the history of iGEM, what iGEM is, the benefits and learning experiences acquired when being a member of an iGEM team, as well as information about our project Canditect. Our goal with this presentation was to both spread awareness about our project and what we are trying to accomplish, as well as inspire new students to join next year’s team."
UiOslo Norway,Education & Engagement,Social media,"A very effective way to spread awareness about our project is to use social media. Since the UiOslo_Norway Team already had a Facebook and an Instagram account, we wanted to keep these pages alive. We had different approaches for each social media platform. At our Facebook page we started with team-member introduction weeks. Every Monday we posted a short summary of every team member, about the duties and responsibilities the person had in the group, as well as general information about the person. After presenting all members it was time to present our project by launching project-description-Tuesdays. The aim of these posts was to inform our followers on how our project was built up, which world-wide problems we wanted to face with our work and what kind of components we are going to use. Lastly, we launched collaboration-Wednesdays, showcasing our collaborations with other iGEM Teams from Europe. If you wanted to know more about the daily life of our team, following our Instagram page would be the right choice. There we posted pictures about our group meetings, and funny moments in lab. Of course, our team was also meeting each other in the evenings or weekends after a hard work day in lab. You could always be up to date on our leisure activities if you followed us on Instagram.If you are interested about our Facebook and Instagram pages, follow us:We will also be posting during the Giant Jamboree, stay tuned!"

The festival is part of Oslo Innovation Week. During the event there were presentations, workshops, debates and exhibitions. We presented our project with a poster and a stand. We are grateful for the opportunity to both present our project to people with various backgrounds, as well as the chance to come in contact with several companies that could help us take our project further. Additionally, we attended several talks about the genetic revolution, and how we can use current DNA editing tools in an innovative way."
UiOslo Norway,Education & Engagement,EVOGENE seminar,"In October, our team had the opportunity to present our project to the research Section for Genetics and Evolutionary Biology (EVOGENE), but also showcase the iGEM competition. EVOGENE is a research and learning environment based on a broad range of biological disciplines that merge in the perception of genetics and evolutionary thinking as a basis for their endeavor. In the first part of the lecture we gave the audience an introduction into iGEM and how important this competition is for students in matters of learning how to conduct a scientific project. After that we presented our “Canditect” project.It was a great to have the opportunity to practice our presentation we will be holding in Boston. Furthermore, we could practice answering questions from the audience, and received a lot of valuable feedback.After the EVOGENE presentation, Åslaug Brynildsen held a presentation workshop for us. She is a science- and communications advisor at the University of Oslo, but also a former theatre performer. During the workshop she provided us with a lot of useful tips on how to use our voice and body language in an engaging way. She gave us useful tips on how to make our presentation more interesting for the audience, through the use of animations and humour."

Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,Overview,"Engineered probiotics are a growing technology that has the power to revolutionize the way we treat and prevent diseases. With that in mind, we focused our Human Practices activities on spreading the word about engineered probiotics. We created a collection of parts in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and participated in Brazilian's regulatory agency public consultation about probiotics. Come with us and learn more about our HP activities!"
Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,Probiotics Collection,"
When we started working with genetically engineered probiotics, we went to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts to look for parts that could be useful in our project, especially regarding the chassis Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis. That was a frustrating experience: it was super hard to find these parts even knowing that several past teams had already worked with engineered probiotics. So, we thought: why not create a collection with all the parts we can find and might be useful to engineer probiotics?

We started to look for every team since iGEM has begun, that had worked with engineered probiotics or created related parts that could be useful to engineer them. After creating a list of teams, projects, and parts, we categorized them first by the most common probiotic chassis: Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus spp. and Bacillus subtilis. Then, we separated these parts by function, into four categories.



To access the collection, click here.

We invite other teams to collaborate and submit new parts in this collection by categorizing them in the submission parts form. To do that, when choosing the category select:

//collections/probiotics
//collections/probiotics/[function]
//chassis/[your chassis]

Besides creating the Collection at the Registry, we also published the review ""Engineering Microbial Living Therapeutics: The Synthetic Biology Toolbox"" in Trends in Biotechnology by CellPress as a part of ReviewSeries: iGEM Perspectives on Synthetic Biology. In this review, we present the available parts to engineer living therapeutics and the parts available at the Registry. You can find it here.

We hope this collection to be useful for future teams interested in working with genetically engineered probiotics and help them find parts easily.

Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,The gaps in Brazilian legislation,"
Brazilian legislation is still in its first steps when it comes to genetically engineered organisms. ANVISA (Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency) is the agency in charge of regulating all the health-related products such as drugs, food, and cosmetics in Brazil and who oversees regulating GMOs is CTNBio (National Technical Commission for Biosafety). However, when a health-related product holds a genetically modified organism both agencies need to work together to approve the product, however it is not easy for ANVISA to properly label and address this new product due the presence of a GMO, and a product that is hard to address entail to a slow in the regulation process. Therefore, genetically engineered products need a proper labeling in the ANVISA’s legislation. 
Besides that, not much about GMOs was covered in the current legislation. Genetic engineering is currently researched and studied all across the globe, and laws need to follow this new trend.
"
Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,What the Agency did to overcome this limitation?,"
Even though the agency covers a lot of fields, the field of food supplements in general, including probiotics, required updates. Because of that ANVISA launched a public consultation about this topic.
"
Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,How we tackled this issue?,"
Our team knew that participating in such a consultation would be key to change how the Brazilian government deals with probiotics (which is the main topic of our research project). ANVISA created this public consultation in regards to opening a proposal that establishes and regulate food supplements such as bioactive substances, enzymes, and probiotics. Our main goal was to include in the legislation genetically engineered food supplement and to prove that this topic is interesting and important to Brazilian researchers, also raising awareness about it. Many big international companies and entities participated in the consultation, including Bayer SA, Pfizer, Nestlé, Yakult, International Probiotics Association, The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics, and of course iGEM UNESP team.
"
Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,Our contribution to the public consultation,"
We were able to send different suggestions regarding changing what has been written in the original legislation. We suggested changes in the definition of probiotics, the tests needed to certify the safety of the food supplement and other related topics. Since the main goal of our team is to develop a genetically engineered probiotic all these suggestions were very needed. Articles, researches, and books references were used to sustain the suggestions. However, most of our indications were similar to what other people have written and suggested. Nevertheless, our main contribution was regarding the use and control of genetically engineered organism in food supplements, even though we had a legislation and laws regarding probiotic, nothing was said about genetically engineered products. Using research papers and even our own research material we managed to sustain our suggestion, leaving it clear that genetically engineered probiotic is a studied and invested topic, therefore, a legislation regarding it needs to be created.
"
Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,What kind of an impact it is making?,"
After that, a reunion occurred at ANVISA head office in Brasilia, where all the suggestions were discussed being accepted or rejected. A month later the results came. Most of our suggestions were accepted. Our contribution about including genetically engineered organisms in food supplements was accepted but with a reservation, the genetically engineered product would need first to be approved by the CTNBio and then it would be analyzed by ANVISA. 
"
Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,Why is it important?,"
That's a huge step because even though CTNBio deals with GMO it can't regulate probiotics. Before our contribution, a genetically engineered probiotic would first be analyzed by CTNBio but after that ANVISA would not allow it to be produced because there wasn't any topic regarding it existing, thus, it would be needed to create a special validation process for this product, making the whole process take even longer. After our contribution, ANVISA would simply require the needed tests and after that, the product would be accepted to be produced. This represents a key change since a regular ANVISA validation process takes around five years.
Our contribution also represents the need for a more updated legislation that fulfills the needs of the new researches across our country. Genetic Engineering is being studied in almost every state and region in Brazil, the laws that regulate science need to follow this trend. 

You can find the public consultation here and the report where our proposals were accepted here (in Portuguese).

Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,Dialog with Libbs Pharmaceutical,"
Early this year we got in touch with Libbs, a Brazilian pharmaceutical company and one of the top 10 biggest players in the Brazilian pharmaceutical market. We had video conferences with Dr. Rafaela Gouveia and Dr. Giuliano Barissa, both from the External Research & Development department at Libbs. We talked about their thoughts on our project and our technology, and gave us unique insights about how we could build something that could be really interesting and useful to pharmaceutical companies: questions about safety, cost, scale-up, market, and regulations.

At the first time we met, we talked about our 2017’s iGEM project, Insubiota, that aims to offer an alternative treatment for type 1 diabetes with an engineered probiotic, and they suggested that we could apply this technology to other diseases and metabolic disorders, like lactose intolerance. We started to think how we could improve our previous project in a way that would be easy to change the parts in the circuits. That motivated us to design and build a framework useful to easily engineer probiotics to treat other diseases rather than just type 1 diabetes, and that was the birth of our framework: Hope.
Additionally, they informed us about and invited us to participate in an ANVISA - National Health Surveillance Agency (Brazilian regulatory agency) public consultation that was open by that time about probiotics, that they and several other pharmaceutical companies were participating, and would be awesome to have people outside the pharmaceutical companies participating as well. Because we believe laws and regulation must be built with the community, we answered the call and participate in the public consultation.
In our document, we explained about engineered probiotics, their importance and applications, and why they should be included in regulation and we were super happy and excited when we found out that our suggestions were accepted by ANVISA and engineered probiotics were included in the regulation! You can learn all about our work with ANVISA by clicking here.

In addition to our conversations, later in the year, we arranged a visit to Libbs so we could talk with Dr. Rafaela in person, tell her about our project and our progress, and visit the production plant of pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals. 
We still keep in contact with Libbs and we love to hear their thoughts and insights about our project and we hope we could build great things together to solve real-world problems!

Unesp Brazil,HUMAN PRACTICES,Intellectual Property with Lawyer David Soares da Silva,"
Over this year we got in touch with David Soares da Silva and Clarissa Jucá Gallo, two big supporters of our team. David is a lawyer who has collaborated with our team since last year. This year he came to our College in Araraquara to know us personally, learn more about our project and to instruct us on ways to legally protect our work, talking to us about important information on intellectual property and legislation that can help us to carry out our work. His suggestions and insights may also help us in founding a startup in the future. We are grateful for meeting David and Clarissa, all the support we have received from them, and we hope to accomplish great things together in the future.

UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Relevance,"The field of synthetic biology encompasses a range of interconnected disciplines beyond molecular science and chemical engineering, which was verified at our symposium. As such, the iGEM UNSW team wanted to engage with different groups within the academic space to consider different perspectives on our project. Two members of our team gave a lecture to students in an Arts and Social Sciences class. They gave a basic overview of our scaffold’s use and the underlying science, but then focused on the ethical, legal and commercial implications of our system. The team also presented to academics from the UNSW School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular sciences at a staff meeting. This discussion was focused on the science that formed the basis of our scaffold, and was a platform from which academics could later engage with us – by establishing in which parts of our project they were interested. "
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,On the Day,"With this in mind, the UNSW iGEM team hosted a symposium that gathered experts from a variety of synthetic biology-related fields, to engage in a Q&A with members of the wider community. Friends, family and colleagues were invited to listen and pose questions loosely relating to the title of the session, ‘Challenges in the Australian Innovation Landscape for Synthetic Biology’. The experts that made up the panel were:The discussion was guided by one of our team members, and engaged with topics as varied as the importance of educating the public, commercialisation, ethics, open source science, and future applications. To see the full two-hour symposium video, which was uploaded to YouTube, please click here. Alternatively, view the highlight compilation:Presentations were also given by ourselves, the iGEM team from Macquarie University and the University of Sydney BIOMOD team on our 2018 projects. This gave the gathered audience and experts an opportunity to engage with current innovations in the space, and provide their feedback during the networking hour. Perspectives from the attendees and speakers were not only gathered anecdotally by our team, but also through a short attendance survey that helped us understand the demographic of our audience and encourage their engagement."

Hugh is also tasked by DPI with identifying research projects with applications to primary industries such as forestry agriculture and fisheries. Hugh completed his PhD at the Université Aix Marseille in France and the University of Sydney in Australia in 2015."
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Outcomes and Analysis,"Presenting to the Arts and Social Sciences class was an opportunity to expose the students to synthetic biology, whilst giving us the chance to answer questions from a ‘human practices’ perspective. The presentation was a great way for us to experiment with how people from a non-science background would respond to our project. We were able to fine tune our presenting skills to inspire audiences across a spectrum of possible scientific backgrounds (none, in this case). The presentation itself focused on the open-source nature of the iGEM competition, and compared this with the usual secrecy associated with scientific research and the protective legal frameworks which require secrecy. The questions asked by students were generally more focused around safety concerns. The feedback received from both groups was positive, and led us to opening up further avenues for future discussion and research. We also managed to shed new light on the challenges surrounding the future of synthetic biology from both a biological and social perspective and how overcoming these challenges will change how we practice medicine, produce food and energy, and manage the environment."
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Defining Synthetic Biology,"Prior to the discussions, the audience were asked to evaluate their understanding of synthetic biology. Despite over 97% of the attendants having heard of the term before, 32% of them seemed unsure about its definition. This was a common theme that we encountered amongst discussions with our family and friends.Similarly, the panellists gave diverse answers when challenged to define the term. From discussing the evolution of the field of molecular biology to considering the interface between the organic and inorganic, the speakers all came back to the idea that this space has been built by combining previous research, scientific principles, and an overarching goal to invent promising new technologies. At one point, Matthew Kearnes even included the audience by asking them from what field of science or engineering they identify with, and using the range of responses from engineers, chemists, biologists and social scientists to illustrate the diversity and inclusivity of the field of synthetic biology. However, the common thread throughout this part of the discussion was that synthetic biology focuses on applying engineering principles to biological systems to build reliable methods and tools. This is backed by the literature1,2, with the key philosophies behind most projects being rational design, modularity, abstraction and novelty; all paradigms that stem from engineering practices and commercialising processes. "
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Engaging with the public,"The symposium emphasised the importance of engaging in multidirectional dialogue to obtain the views of the public, with Matthew Kearnes being a particularly strong advocate. The panel speculated about which interest group drives the conversation behind the viability of a synthetic biology tool, with the importance of community engagement as a recurring consideration.The speakers touched on how saturating the general public with scientific jargon can be isolating but highlighted the need for scientists to address the natural speculation and fear that the public can have, referencing Monsanto as a case study. From there, the speakers urged our team and the audience to provide the community with appropriate channels for consultation as part of the bioethical due diligence for a project. This will give the public greater access to decisions and information about a certain technological development. "
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Commercialisation,"Carl Stubbings, one of the panellists, also ensured that the commercial reality of science was presented in conjunction with the ‘scientist’s view’. He spoke about how any technology has to have a market need and a reason for adoption. The panel discussed how without an identifiable need in the community, even the most brilliant new technology would not be used. As a result, our team realised how important it is for scientists and engineers to go out into the community and not just look for ethical issues, but ask if people think the technology is valuable."
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Challenges for Innovation,"As suggested by the title of the symposium, the panellists were prompted throughout the questions to provide insight on the challenges or barriers they perceived were faced by teams developing innovative synthetic biology tools, especially from an Australian perspective. In addition to the previously discussed issues of product adoption and clear public engagement, other issues such as research costs and access to funding were explored. The fact that projects developed in Australia had a much lesser prospect of accessing the “Bay Area Scene” in the United States highlights how innovation in Australia is somewhat less advantageous. However, as mentioned by Kearnes, the innovation culture in Australia is booming regardless thanks to growing support from the government, with A$13 million invested by CSIRO to establish the Synthetic Biology Future Science Platform2."
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Research,"In deciding to create an educational package based around our school workshop, we looked to previous iGEM teams to get ideas on the best way to construct such a tool. We took inspiration from the William and Mary 2015 iGEM team, who developed a comprehensive booklet of experiments and activities relating to synthetic biology for schools in the state of Virginia, USA. Other iGEM teams have pursued similar ideas, including Aachen 2016 and Toulouse 2016, however both of these documents were seen as difficult to adapt to an Australian context, due to language barriers. Using the William and Mary 2017 iGEM team’s educational outreach database, we discovered that such distributive educational tools were limited. Noting this, our team was confident that adapting previous educational documents to an Australian context would effectively emulate the ethos of accessible synthetic biology education.In order to develop a truly useful package that addressed the new state syllabus, the team discussed ideas with a syllabus notes developer named Maddie, who specialises in the upper high school Biology courses. This allowed the ‘package’ idea to be fine-tuned, part of which included introducing a “How to Use This Package” document for teachers, that outlined how their required teaching outcomes were met by the package content.Developing the document from the workshop involved cutting out elements that had been identified as key in engaging students in challenging topics such as biotechnology and synthetic biology. Students would most likely no longer have access to authentic research materials and equipment, and would be learning from their teacher rather than a novel presenter. Although these sacrifices were necessary to ensure students state-wide had realistic access to this educational support, the team used other techniques to ensure that the resulting package was still interesting. This included adapting certain parts of the package to use group based learning and inquiry-based practicals for high engagement levels, rather than the more inefficient ‘transmission of information approach’2. This idea of “workshop-based biology” was developed throughout the whole package3."
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,On the day,"UNSW iGEM created and ran a ‘University Biology’ taster workshop for a group of students from a Sydney girls’ school (Roseville College). The day included presentations from the team, hands-on experiments and handouts, in order to engage the students in stimulating conversations about enzymes, synthetic biology, and university life more generally.The excursion started with presentations from the team to teach the students about more advanced enzyme concepts, like inhibition, before diving into some hands-on practical work. This included teaching the students how to use air displacement micro-pipettes, a piece of equipment they could not access at their school. These skills were used as part of an investigation into the digestive function of lipase, which was then linked back to nutrition (and other school modules) that they had previously studied. The team ended the day with a discussion of genetic engineering, particularly with regards to the use of genetic switches, by providing the students with Pichia Pastoris plates to observe. These plates had genetically recombined lipase activity, and were able to illustrate to the students how methanol in the plate media could switch on lipase activity.As the students left, they each received an envelope detailing a different one of our team’s favourite enzymes, with an image and short description. Their teacher had previously informed us that each student had to be very familiar with one enzyme for a depth study, and so we provided them with information on a range of enzymes that were likely novel for them.   "
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Outcomes,"The session was a generally positive experience, with the teacher giving us praise for our efforts and enthusiasm.

The students were asked to do a survey after completing the excursion and they also had a positive response to the experience. The survey allowed students to make comments on the excursion, enabling us to gauge possible improvements to the session for the future – some of which are detailed below.Table 1: Suggestions from the survey of students conducted after the excursion that could be used to improve the session.The survey also indicated that there is potential for development of other sessions that are specific to the other modules of the syllabus, particularly since the majority of students (when asked) expressed interest in ‘genetics’ and ‘medicine’. Expanding on either of these topics would allow for improved engagement with the concept of synthetic biology. However, time and resource limitations meant that further lesson development was alternatively channelled into a creating a teaching package from the lessons that were given in the workshop. This is also targeted at upper high school students, particularly those learning the new Biology syllabus."
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Julia Gale (Roseville Ladies College):,"“Dear iGEM and Chris,Thank you again for Thursday. The girls really enjoyed the day and absolutely loved receiving the ‘My Favourite Enzyme’ envelopes after the session. Thank you for attaching the PowerPoint and again for all your hard work in making sure the day was filled with valuable learning about enzymes.Kind regards,Julia”"
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Distribution,"The package was distributed to a range of high school biology teachers throughout the New South Wales state via a sharable Google Doc. Please click on the icon below to view our finalised package as of the end of iGEM 2018:Our package has also been uploaded to a Google Drive folder because it allows our team to edit and add resources to the package, even after its distribution. For example, future teams could build on the content in the package, potentially addressing other syllabus modules and adding new experiments. It also allows teachers and schools to easily share the package with colleagues using standard online communication methods.To further ensure this package was accessible and adaptable, the team decided to provide the components of the package in editable document formats (such as Word and PowerPoint), rather than in fully formatted PDF files. This allows teachers to download the files as a base, and modify them however they see fit to effectively teach their class. We believe this is important, as there is a move within the education system to encourage flexible teaching and learning approaches and it is therefore necessary to have a package that is similarly able to adapt to the needs of teachers."
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,"Christine Fira (Maclean High School, NSW):",“I am highly impressed with the package as it covers a range of syllabus outcomes and ties them together in a very interesting way. The segue sections are most interesting. The powerpoint was clear and succinct and the simpler experiment could be easily achieved by all students in a typical class with a wide range of abilities. Thank you for the opportunity to view this. Your team has produced and interesting and quality package that I look forward to using.”
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Anonymous:,"“While I can see that the educational package is great, it seems like it would only be possible to perform the experiments in well-funded schools. Just as a constructive criticism, I think you guys should do more research on what is readily available in schools in NSW, especially public schools. A lot of public schools don’t have access to things like spectrophotometers and microcentrifuge tubes. I can see this package working well in a selective school/private school setting, but not in the classrooms of regular public schools in NSW. Criticisms aside, I think that it’s great you guys are thinking about the future generation of scientists by providing teachers with such resources!”"
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Looking Forward,"The aim was to set up this package as the foundation for developments and contributions to the upper high school Biology community in years to come. By setting up the groundwork for a comprehensive educational package within an Australian context, we hope that other Australian teams and interested parties can develop the package to continue to be part of the movement of universities incubating the scientists and engineers of the future. In reviewing the package and the feedback received, we propose the following improvements that could be made upon the package: The scope for future work is endless, with a vast choice of inspiration to draw from other iGEM teams. We hope that this package will continue to be developed so that young STEM students in Australia will be given the same opportunities and inspirations that our team has been so lucky to receive. "
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Article,"After developing an understanding of the importance of providing greater access to information regarding synthetic biology technologies, iGEM UNSW decided to compose an article for the non-profit society, Synthetic Biology Australia (SBA). The article, which detailed the science behind and needs addressed by our project was published on the SBA website and then shared via our social media and faculty connections. Please read the article by clicking on the picture below:The SBA society was established in 2014 to support the growing synthetic biology research field in Australia, New Zealand and the broader Australasian region. It achieves this by facilitating collaborations within its community hub, assisting academics and industry in public outreach, and providing education and training – making it the perfect channel for us to spread the word about our project. "
UNSW Australia,Education & Engagement,Outcomes ,"Although the analytics about page viewing numbers could not be accessed, the SBA has a broad reach with over 200 participants attending their 2017 conference. This article has allowed for our team to reflect on our project development as, being written in early July, it is an example of the earliest iteration of our project. In conjunction with the  description page, it shows all the learning process and changes the team has gone through in shaping the scaffold system and its proposed application. This is the result of significant wet-lab testing, mathematical modelling and human practices work all contributing to the refining of our modular and novel tool. "
Uppsala,Human Practice,Fighting the Hidden Resistance,"The nematode parasites Cyathostominae, also known as small strongyles, cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. The economic burden of these parasites is forecasted to increase, since these worms are rapidly gaining resistance to most drugs used to combat them. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these small strongyles. Our vision has been to apply synthetic biology to the untouched field of veterinary diagnostics by developing a better tool for detection, thus decreasing the growth of resistance among small strongyles. While working toward the goal of creating a reprogrammed smart bacteria (nicknamed the Worm Buster) to detect and report the presence of small strongyles, we discovered new useful applications of existing techniques along the way. This has brought our vision about the Worm Buster closer to being achievable, which in the future will provide the tools necessary to help farmers make a decision whether to treat their animals or not.

                        Our work has laid the foundation for our idea to someday potentially come to fruition. Our novel applications of cutting edge techniques such as phage display and transcriptomics using Oxford Nanopore MinION third generation sequencing provide groundwork for further expansions in the field of veterinary diagnostics.   "
Uppsala,Human Practice,Symptoms,"When the worms migrate into the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms it may form an embolism which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic [13]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death [3].
                        Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection. This makes the need for the second Worm Buster even larger."
Uppsala,Human Practice,Current Methods for Detection,"To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them. The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [11, 12, 16]. 
                        In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to graze on. Therefore we have analysed the possibility of developing the second Worm Buster by studying fluorescence in grass samples. Our results were promising since the fluorescence was clearly visible in the grass!"
Uppsala,Human Practice,Resistance Development,"Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection  of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [1,4]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance [1]. 

                        Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15]. 

                        Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of horse intestines. Moreover, we have developed new applications on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the Worm Buster. 

                        By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the Worm Buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should be but also when the treatments should happen. Thus they complement each other to minimize the amount of anthelmintics used, thereby helping to prevent resistance development."
Uppsala,Human Practice,Requirements,The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment depending on the level of small strongyle infection.
Uppsala,Human Practice, 2. Transcriptomics + Phage Display,"As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we needed an approach that would allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we developed new applications of two existing techniques."
Uppsala,Human Practice,Optimization of the Time Between Treatments,"To make sure that the unnecessary use of anthelmintics is minimized we have created a model that compares regular and optimized usage of anthelmintics. When referring to the optimized use of anthelmintics, this means that the horse only receives treatment when the amount of parasites exceeds a certain threshold. Our model calculates given the initial amount of worms on the pasture and in the horse. Ideally, the information could be used with the Worm Buster to get a better overall result of our project. Our solution will not only be able to tell how large the treatments should be but also when they should be administered. This would guarantee the lowest amount of anthelmintics usage, and hopefully help combat the issue of growing resistance. Due to this fact, our model constitutes a large improvement on the potential implementation of our project since it directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses. "
Uppsala,Human Practice,Survey Analysis,"When we had chosen to create a Worm Buster, we wanted to see if there was a market for this kind of product. To gain knowledge about the market we conducted a market analysis together with the human practices group. The modeling group worked with creating a program that could use the information from the market analysis and see if correlations could be found between different variables."
Uppsala,Human Practice,Raising Awareness,"We have attacked the problem at several angles to raise awareness for our project. We have performed a market analysis of the problem and sent out questionnaires to better judge the severity of the problem. We’ve even been published in a local swedish magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.  "
Uppsala,Human Practice,Financial perspective,"The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training and sports stables, and riding schools [18]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields [17]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [18, 19]. A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
                        Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we have worked on the market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions actually will be possible to implement in real life."
Uppsala,Human Practice, Uppsala 2018 is on a mission for the future of iGEM,In iGEM Uppsala we are worried about the future of iGEM members wellbeing and have seen multiple cases of burnouts. This is something that has to be changed to make iGEM sustainable for the future. To combat this problem we have hosted an event with iGEM Stockholm and Lund which shed light on the growing problem of burnouts and how to prevent them. To further spread the knowledge we have published a booklet about it! The booklet is a summary of useful guidelines and techniques to prevent team members from burn outs. It also speaks about the current situation in iGEM which we have summarised after performing an international survey with answers from current team members and previous team members all over the world.

"
Uppsala,Human Practices, Vidilab ," Vidilab (a veterinary diagnostics company) was consulted at multiple points in our project. From the very beginning, when we didn’t even have a project, to the very end of our lab period in august we talked with both management (the CEO, Bitte Ljungström) and researchers at the company (Alice Anlind, Sara Hägglund Ljungström). From these discussions, we learnt about the major issues of the field and how large the need was for a new diagnostic tool for small strongyles. In the end this was the reason why we decided to take up the fight against these parasites.  Initially, our project focused mainly on small strongyles and in vitro diagnosis of the encysted larvae. From the literature we learnt that small strongyles formes cysts containing hundreds of individual worms in the intestinal tract of horses. It was these cysts that we initially planned to detect and isolate from horse tissue and co-culture them with bacteria. Vidilab was kind enough to provide access to horse tissue with encysted larvae. The cysts we received did not correspond with what we initially expected due to our previous research. Because of this, we decided to focus on detection of the worms rather than the cysts. But as we knew, free floating small strongyles do not put the horse into significant danger. Instead we decided only to focus on providing farmers with better information about their horses’ wellbeing. Thanks to Vidilab we also knew that the usage of anthelmintics is leading towards resistance development in the strongyle population, turning them into a threat to the equine industry and horses’ physical health. By administering more accurate treatments, the resistance development rate among the strongyles could possibly be decreased.During our second visit to Vidilab they also informed us about the difficulties with detecting large strongyles since all current techniques are based on egg counting in grass samples. After some consideration we outlined a strategy to battle this problem as well. First of all we wanted to investigate the need for a better preventative tool for large strongyle infections. In order to gather data we worked on a market analysis based on a survey that we spread among horse owners in Sweden. Secondly, we wanted to try and see if a similar system as we outlined for the small strongyles could work with large strongyles present in grass, hence we made an analysis of the visibility of fluorescent proteins in grass sampling. "
Uppsala,Human Practices, Horse Owners , We used every opportunity we had at our disposal to discuss our project with horse owners. From these discussions we learned about the best ways of isolating samples and about the difficulty of isolating urine from a horse. We therefore moved on to investigating detection methods in feces. These interviews also gave us the idea to start investigating on a larger scale to what extent the horse owners are aware of issues related to strongyle infections — and the idea of conducting a market analysis was born. 
Uppsala,Human Practices, Veterinarians ," We contacted different veterinarians in the beginning of the project to see what their experience with strongyles was. The overall view was that they did not know about horses becoming ill from a large amount of small strongyles, but they mostly spoke of the negative effects with large strongyles. These results pushed us to investigate more about large strongyle infections. 

"
Uppsala,Human Practices, Multinational Market Research ," Before we could start with our project we first needed to look into whether there was a market for our diagnostic tool and whether we could shape the potential product to an existing niche. We were interested in the actual state of urgency of the disease along with potential concerns for the future, though as can be seen from the above mentioned communication we had been receiving some conflicting information. Some sources would state that strongyle infections are of relatively small concern – while others would see it as a large issue. To analyse this further we conducted a market analysis based on a survey that was distributed not only in Sweden but also abroad. This confirmed that the needs of the horse owners regarding large and small strongyles was consistent with Vidilabs needs, indicating that the majority of each stakeholder had the same view of the current situation. This was noticeable in the concern regarding small strongyles, contradicting some of our skeptical sources. In addition, we used the opportunity to gather data about how a GMO based diagnostic tool would be perceived among horse owners.  Also, to advocate our stance that the amount of treatments can be optimized, we needed to know the mean amount of treatments performed on each horse per year. We received this data as part of our market analysis. Our predictive model simulating the extent of strongyle infection depending on the amount of anthelmintic treatments suggests that the current situation can indeed be optimized. Fewer treatments than the average today would decrease the risk of developing anthelmintic resistance and still keep the horses healthy.  The market analysis gave us insight into the horse-owners perspective and it resulted in the objective data that we needed to draw our conclusions. We used the data from the survey to confirm our project strategy and to build our different models. "
Uppsala,Human Practices," GMO, Welcomed by the Public "," By authoring and distributing a survey to horse owners we could see that the majority of respondents in Sweden had positive attitudes (83.2 %, 368 respondents) towards a GMO-type of diagnosis method. The survey also showed a public fear of growing anthelmintics resistance against blood worms (strongyles) (77.3% of 370 respondents ranked their fear as 4 or 5 were 5 being the most concerned). "
Uppsala,Human Practices, Environmental Impact and Risk ," The E. coli (BL-21, DH5-alpha) that was used in the lab has a biosafety level of 1, which is the lowest possible on a scale of 4 [7]. This means that E. coli is safe to work with in the course laboratories we were provided with by Uppsala University [8].  Nothing that is considered toxic or harmful was genetically introduced (UnaG, amilGFP) into our E.coli. However, for cultivation and selection purposes used in common synthetic biology practical work, antibiotic resistance was also introduced which presents a risk in the potential spread of antibiotic resistance (Chloramphenicol, Ampicillin, Tetracycline), if these plasmids were to spread into the environment. This was avoided to a large degree by following standard lab practise with specific guidelines regarding waste disposal of GMOs.    The ability for proliferation of GMOs and organisms in general is determined by their fitness. As a rule of thumb regarding the spread of GMOs in the environment, fitness is greatly reduced for most lab strains of microorganisms since they have been modified in numerous ways to make them easy to work with. These are not adaptations that are suitable for their natural environment, giving them a negative fitness contribution [9]. Regarding the risks associated with nematodes, you can look at the separate  safety form and select Uppsala from the menu.  This was the first time a team tried to see if this is an applicable solution to diagnose parasitic infections caused by nematodes in equines; it is thus a long way from a potentially finalized product. If a product would surface in the future, further risk assessments must be evaluated to see if an engineered product would be deemed safe to be orally ingested by a living host. Since an enteric diagnostic system based on bacteria is a novel approach there is little to be found in the literature about its applied effects.  In addition to internal reviews, it is common for an external entity (like a government) to perform reviews on the product, especially if the product is classified as a GMO. This is necessary to ensure that the product is safe before letting it hit the market."
Uppsala,Human Practices, Understanding Your Limits - a Burnout Guidebook ,"Mental health awareness is being brought into the spotlight in society, yet talking about it is still a taboo in many settings. For instance, in a project that you truly care for, the risks and warning signs might go by unrecognized. It is an art to find balance at work but in our opinion it is an essential part of success in the long run. Therefore, the Uppsala iGEM team has chosen to acknowledge the importance of understanding one’s limits by writing a guide-book on the topic.The premise and purpose of the guidebook is that many iGEM teams in retrospect have admitted that the work environment during the iGEM competition oftentimes becomes stressful. Factors such as level of experience, responsibilities, ambitions and deadlines drive projects forward but at the same time easily lead to feelings of being overwhelmed and an increases risk of burning out. Though we’re speaking mainly of the iGEM competition here, the topic of stress at work is universally applicable. Therefore we wanted to address this topic by creating material that anyone who seeks guidance can relate to and use. We tried to make our guidebook as universal as possible to people both inside and outside of academia. In this little book we have compiled some general background about stress, exhaustion, and burnout in order to explain the issue and show that these topics deserve your attention. This is followed by suggestions of some preventive measures that we have found suitable. Some parts of the book might be a repetition of old truths but we try to mix it up with a mix of unique advice and mindfulness exercises. In the guidebook you can also find some statistics about stress levels in different iGEM teams over the years. This is a preview of the iGEM work environment report that the iGEM Uppsala association is working on based on the survey described further down. Also, check out the chapter “The Importance of Authenticity in Organization” from the guidebook written by iGEM Lund’s 2018 team.  They have also been focusing on improving the work environment, but instead of more general stress management techniques their guidebook is directed towards hands-on approaches for increasing efficiency through organization of work.  Our hope is that we will encourage people not to overlook the importance of their well-being, and to have a healthier relationship with their work. We hope to give back to the iGEM community for all the wonderful experiences that we’ve had, and we hope that future iGEM teams especially will take note of the advice in “Understanding your Limits - a Burnout Guidebook”.  iGEM is a giving platform for young brilliant people to do truly amazing things.  Since brilliant people (usually) don't retire after participating in iGEM, it’s important to take care of yourselves.  The world needs you."

Uppsala,Public Engagement, Introduction," The aspiration to explore how, what we are doing fits into the society required us to first reach out to the public. Connecting to the general public, academia as well as those who our project is directly aimed to help, the horse owner community, required some different approaches. We have kept the goal throughout the project to make our science approachable to as many as possible although at times we did dive into specifics. In order to introduce ourselves to different groups with different interests and different knowledge we have been working on several mini-projects such as a symposium “Limits of Life”, lectures for various audiences as well as reaching out via different media. "
Uppsala,Public Engagement,Symposium – Limits of Life,"Human Practices is all about bringing the science to the people and what better way to do this then to create a big event, where everyone (scientists, academics and further citizens) is invited? This was the start of the collaboration between iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Stockholm with further support from iGEM Lund. Our goal was to organize an event that would break down the differences between scientists and non academic people by bringing up subjects that everyone can recognize themselves in, as well as introducing synthetic biology to those who wanted to learn more about it. Together we organized a symposium in Uppsala called “Limits of Life” that was divided into two sessions."
Uppsala,Public Engagement, Understanding Your Limits ,"The first session was called “Understanding Your Limits”, where topics covering iGEM, burnout, stress, mindfulness and general tips of balancing your life, no matter what background you might have, were presented. To this session we had invited 3 different speakers, starting with Will Wright (iGEM ambassador), Marie Åsberg (professor emerita at Karolinska Institutet) and Jonas Nielsen (member of Uppsala iGEM 2018). Mr Wright introduced what iGEM is to the mixed audience and explained what challenges every iGEM team encounters no matter what field they may work within, considering the stress factor, and tips of how to avoid them by putting a lot of effort into the structure of the project. Mrs Åsberg then continued with presenting gradually symptoms of burnout and tips on how the individuals can recognize the symptoms and start changing their lifestyle to be more enduring. Mr Nielsen then held a very appreciated workshop about mindfulness to provide a practical tools for the audience to use in the stressful lifestyle that is so common among us. From this session both the participants and audience learned something new, whether it was a practical tool to handle a stressful lifestyle or learning more about iGEM."
Uppsala,Public Engagement, Hacking Life ,"The second session was called “Hacking Life”, where we organized a panel discussion that introduced the topic of synthetic biology as well as different ethical aspects and future applications. The panel was represented by Hannes Sjöblad (Swedish ambassador for Singularity University (NASA) with a background of biohacking), Per Sandin (associate professor in philosophy, and a senior lecturer in bioethics and environmental ethics at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences) and Jens Sundström (is a member of the swedish genetics committee and a senior lecturer at the institution for plant biology at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences). The panel was moderated by Nicolai Dorka (member of Stockholm iGEM 2018) and Niclas Fahlander (member of Uppsala iGEM 2018).

Uppsala,Public Engagement, Lectures ,
Uppsala,Public Engagement, Taking every chance to spread the word - BEST lecture ,"BEST (Board of European Students of Technology), an introductory summer course in synthetic biology held in the same lab-corridor. It was a pleasure to present and discuss our project with a group of students already in the mindset of biotechnology. The students found the presentations interesting and inspirational."
Uppsala,Public Engagement, The Student Conference in Science and Technology 2018. ,"This conference is an annual event at Uppsala University that besides being a place for science enthusiasts to connect simultaneously, fulfills the purpose of communication training at the faculty of science and technology. Students are given an opportunity to give a presentation on a scientific subject in front of a larger audience and receive feedback on rhetorics. The challenge of this talk was adapting it to the diverse audience - students from different disciplines in different stages of their education. However, the public was bewildered by Wormbuster story. Special interest went to phage-display methodology as by coincidence announcement of this years Nobel prize winners in chemistry came the same morning and was pricing the development of the method. "
Uppsala,Public Engagement, SynBio-Hour ," iGEM Uppsala association arranges SynBio-hour every year inviting all who have interest in synthetic biology and student driven projects. After the general introduction about iGEM , Wormbusters took the stage. The interest for iGEM was sparked in many new minds."
Uppsala,Public Engagement, Ridsport - reaching out to horse community ," Ridsport is the biggest magazine about equestrianism and horse breeding in Sweden. They found our story and goals interesting and with their help we got to reach the people who we were trying to help.

Uppsala,Public Engagement, Techna - spreading inspiration among fellow students ," Techna - Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students own newspaper, featured a series of articles following the teams journey. Covering both science and general project-management stories we popularized iGEM in Swedens historically biggest student city. "
Uppsala,Public Engagement,Survey,"In the Uppsala IGEM team 2018’s  booklet  we focused on the topic burning out. We thought that it was a really interesting topic, as it is one of the factors that can affect the proper development of the project as it involve so many people, stress situations, deadlines etc. For this reason, we decided to compose a guideline to prevent and increase the knowledge of this condition. To do so, we started with an internal survey that the IGEM members answered, talking about their experiences during their projects. 



This evaluation consists of 5-6 sections with questions, and it takes more or less 10 minutes to answer it. The survey was constructed by the iGEM Uppsala Association & Team and is constructed to highlight and improve the work environment during the iGEM project and to identify risks that the team needs to be aware of. 




The survey is so far answered by nearly 80 people. In this group we found: former members, members of this year's project and members from other iGEM teams around the world, which provided a broad idea of how their experiences were and how they feel regarding the stress related to the project. Some preliminary statistics were incorporated in our booklet but for future improvements we encourage more iGEMers to participate in this survey. You can find it

Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Education and Public Engagement," Synthetic Biology challenges have only real sense taking into account the effect it has on the improvement of nowadays issues. However, it is also one of the most controversial scientific fields for the public opinion. Currently, access to Synthetic Biology field is hampered by several barriers, such as the necessity of deep technical knowledge and high-cost technologies. In the same way, the presence of common misconceptions in regard to bacteria handling and genetic engineering makes it even more difficult to reach to the general public.  Thus, our aim is to break down all these barriers in order to increase SynBio accessibility into society. To do so, we have created Printeria: a bio-engieering device capable of automating the process of printing genetic circuits in bacteria. 
 "
Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Printeria: SynBio has never been easier,"Under the core values of affordability and reproducibility, Printeria is a compact device with which SynBio can be approached to the public in an innovative, friendly and reduced-cost way. 
Thus, Printeria has been conceived as both and educational and bioartistic tool. With a user-friendly software, it can introduce SynBio into the high school classrooms without the necessity of lab equipments. In the same way, it offers a wide range of opportunities for the bioartist disposal. To prove its social usefulness, we have explored Printeria impact possibilities into society. "
Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Bio Art ,"
“To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; Study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.”
-  Leonardo da Vinci 
 Art exists since the origins of humanity. Likewise, science has always been prompted by a desire of knowing more and more about the world, the nature and life. While developing Printeria, we had the chance to get into the vast applications of the BioArt world: a contemporary art form that adapts scientific methods and biotechnology to explore living systems as artistic subjects (1).  As a consequence, we realized we needed to explore the existant synergy between art and science by getting into the BioArt ways of expression. "
Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Printone: express yourself,"While creating our Printeria Part Collection, we wanted to provide bioartists with a complete DNA toolkit for their artwork production. To do so, we assembled several transcriptional units with our different colour reporters (GFPmut3, sfGFP, YFP, mRFP1, amilCP ) and a variety of promoteres and RBS to get different tones. 
By this way, we finally obtained Printone: a palette of pigmented bacteria, with different colours, fluorescence and intensities, for the entire disposal of the bioartist creativity. Thanks to the information gathered as part of our Integrated dialogue with artist professionals, such as María Peñil and his collegue Mehmet Berkmen, we decided to explore the Microbial Art field: creation of masterpieces with microbial living cells such as bacteria. Thus, we used our palette to introduce, both ourselves and the general public, to the Microbial Art. As María advised us, we tried several inoculating techniques to draw, such as directly pippeting liquid medium or using inoculating loops, to choose these that better fitted with the desired results. Indeed, we even sent some of our Printone samples to María and Mehemet, as they were interested in testing the use of our genetic engineered bacteria to paint their own artworks. Commonly, genetic engineered bacteria bright much more than natural strains, and some of them even express fluorescence, so the artistic possibilites are extended with this kind of microorganism. "
Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Bioartist for one day," How to attract people to SynBio? It is possible to achieve this challenge in a subjective and eye-appealing way? While developing Printeria, we realized we had there the perfect way to approach SynBio to the non-researcher world. Thus, we organized the workshop ‘Bioartist for one day’, in which we demostrated that Printeria living products could be used to create authentic artworks. The activity took place in the Mustang Art Gallery (Elche), a cultural space dedicated to the diffusion of contemporary art. This workshop involved last year high school students of arts, science and social sciences, so we could interact with a wide range of different profiles. In this activity, they created their own ‘living masterpice’. Previously, we did detailed explanation on how to properly use the lab material during simple microbiology protocols. Thus, they learned both from the art and microbiology worlds.  
                   Then, using solid agar plates as a canvas, inoculating loops as brushes and the palette of pigmented bacteria we self-made in the lab as tempera, they blew their minds to do imaginative Microbial Art.  As soon as they finished, petri dishes were collected and kept for a later incubation in our lab. Finally, a gallery of all their beutiful works was published in @printeriaupv Instagram profile, so everyone could share them and create interest into the Bacterial Art. As a conclusion, this workshop was a total success, and both the public and ourselves were delighted to realize the beauty of the microbial world and its simple but yet appealing applications.

Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Yturralde: fusion between art and science," José María Yturralde is an spanish artist widely known for his relationship with science.  He collaborated with artists and scientists to redefine his understanding of shapes, and explored ways that the mainframe computer could be used as a tool for his art (2). In this context, we thought it could be a great idea to introduce him to the vast possibilities of the BioArt, and so learn about his life experiences all at once.
                        We introduced our attendee into the basics of the synbio and the  microbiology protocols. We also disscused the necessity of integrating both art and science, in order to broaden the social art perception. Finally, after showing him our laboratory facilities and the way to safetely handle lab material, he finally was eager to try by himself the creation of agar art.

                      Moreover, as part of this outreach collaboration, we decided to recreate one of his masterpieces, from the well-known collection 'Impossible Figures', with our own genetic engineered bacteria. 
                  To do so, we printed a 3D mold to delimitate the barriers of the drawing, so we could inoculate each coloured bacteria in a compartiment of the solid agar medium. Finally, using bigger than usual agar dishes, we were able to recreate his artwork. After several trials with different colour tones and molds, the final result was perfect.  "
Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Future generations,"High school students are eager to know more about the world they live in. However, students rarely learn about Synthetic Biology inside classrooms. As there is a lack of hand-on STEM curricula, basic concepts such as gene, DNA and bacteria are only explained theoretically. In order to stimulate young people to be curious about science, we decided to do our part in changing this educational approach. 
"
Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Communicating to divulgue,"First, we gave some talks to high school students, in which we talked about: 
"
Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Printeria: educational approach,"Printeria aim is to be used as an educational tool. Taking into account that, generally, people doesn't even know what SynBio, we realized it was necessary to ensure students could use Printeria in a friendly but at the same time technically correct way. We realized we needed to ensure not only the easy and explained use of Printeria, but also the understanding of the biological processes upon each step. Thus, we have developed an biological handbook to be used by both teachers and students. This can be read here:

Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,European Research Night ,"The European Research Night is a wide-public event, promoted under the EU Programme Horizon 2020,  whose objective is to to encourage the scientific vocations and lay public interest into science. 
                  "
Valencia UPV,Public Engagement, Activity ,"As part of the Design Factory Exhibition, we had the chance to show Printeria to all the university community and so introduce the basic concepts of SynBio to those who didn't know about them. We included some visual divulgation posters to attract their attention, such as this one or this BioArt compositions. This was a worthy experience, as many university students were interested in knowing more about SynBio once listening about this year project. "
Valencia UPV,Public Engagement,Design Factory Exhibition," UPV_iGEM is part of the Design Factory Global Network, a network of universities innovation hubs  whose mission is to create change in the world of learning through passion-based culture.

WHU-China,Human Practice,1.Candlelight navigation—communicate with professor,"The motivation of our project came from a conversation between a professor and some of our team members.
In Wuhan University, “Candlelight navigation” is an opportunity for students to directly communicate with professors and get instruction ranging from life to academy. By this chance, we had an unforgettable conversation with Professor Xin Lu who majored in bird ecology in May, 2017. He stressed the importance of environmental protection for many times:” The water of the East Lake used to be so clear that there were always many teachers and students swimming in it… However, because of the deterioration of the ecological environment and excessive sewage discharge, the East Lake was once covered with a layer of horrible green film. From then on, we have no longer seen anyone swimming in the lake…”
Since then, these words has been lingering in our minds. After a year, five people from that conversation joined iGEM. The purpose of the competition was to make the world a better place. At that time, we set the initial blueprint for our project."
WHU-China,Human Practice,2.BioBuilder,"In Wuhan University, iGEM group is builded in March every year. In order to learn more about synthetic biology, some of us visit Boston in winter vacation and take part in a course from Bio-builder in February, 2018. Dr. Natalie Kudull teaches us the basic knowledge of synthetic biology in a heuristic and guiding teaching way. "
WHU-China,Human Practice,3.Visit iGEM headquarter,"In that vocation, we also visited iGEM headquarters. We were full of enthusiasm for iGEM and decided to join the iGEM team, and contribute to make a better world…"
WHU-China,Human Practice,4.East Lake HP set,"(we put these 4 HP activity in this HP set, they are in a series and have strong connection with each other)"
WHU-China,Human Practice,4.1 East Lake Water Quality Test,"Later, in order to take a deep understanding of the environmental problem of the East Lake, especially the eutrophication, which is attributed to phosphorus content, we sampled from three different position of the East Lake, and measured the OD value after using the total phosphorus content measurement kit. After that, we compared it with prepared standard curve to measure the total phosphorus content of East Lake."
WHU-China,Human Practice,4.2 Questionnaire and interview,"In order to know people’s understanding of the eutrophication pollution of the East Lake to make our project more realistic, we did some survey activities. We designed an electronic questionnaire and distributed it in Wuhan University, Xincun Street, East Lake community and the sewage treatment plant. In the end, 85 questionnaires were collected. We processed the data and the result is as follows:"
WHU-China,Human Practice,4.3 Synthetic biology enters the community,"In order to spread the idea of synthetic biology, we contacted with the local community and organized “WHU-iGEM come to the community, synthetic biology science activities”.
We introduced GM, synthetic biology, and the pollution situation of the East Lake water quality to community. Meanwhile, the contents of our project was also included. Not only do we promoted synthetic biology, but also brought some science knowledge and technology to the residents, which enhanced the scientific awareness of them. Finally, this activity achieved great result."
WHU-China,Human Practice,4.4 Summer camp of High school ,"Several high schools visited our collage of Life Science for a summer camp. We popularized the knowledge of biology and synthetic biology for them. Due to their strong demands, we also introduced our project to them and we actively discussed about it."
WHU-China,Human Practice,5.1 problem solving,"After our first round of brainstorm, we found that there is a flaw in our design— we didn’t take the bacteria resistance into consideration. If we intended to use synthetic biology to solve eutrophication, the harmful substances in the environmental water body would have an impact on the expression and bacteria survival, so as the resistance problem. Realizing this, we visited the authoritative algae research base in China—— Institute of hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in April. R. Zhang introduced the most advanced sewage treatment method - the bacterial and algal symbiosis system and the biofilm system. Then, we systematically reviewed the relevant information of it, and made dramatically improved and improvement to our design."
WHU-China,Human Practice,5.2 new lab for WHU-China,"After redesign our project, we found that there were insufficient equipment in our scientific training lab. Fortunately, IHB CAS generously extend a hand to us. R. Zhang instruct us to carry out the experiment related to algae research."
WHU-China,Human Practice,6. Synthetic biology enters the classroom！,"In April 2018, we carried out the ""Synthetic Biology Science Lecture, Microbial Plate Graffiti Competition"", and did propaganda and education work. We guided them to understand the concept of engineering bacteria. To make the learnig process fun, we organized a microbial flat-grain graffiti competition by using engineered E. coli as painting material. This activity gave us the opportunity to educate children about synthetic biology and introduce iGEM."
WHU-China,Human Practice,7. Visit BGI！,"We visited BGI headquarter in May, 2018. During this trip to BGI, we were fortunate to have the chance to communicate with the instructor of the Huada High school team (previously judge). She gave us a lot of help and provided us with some new idea in aspect of HP development and experimental design.

Step by step, we improved it in the process of thinking about how to better deal with the problem of eutrophication caused by excessive phosphorus in environmental waters. Finally, we discovered that the system we built can be applied to the processing of other elements. In the process, some HP plays a decisive role. In the integrated HP category, we will show how these HPs directly influence the direction of our project design—the impact of society and the environment on our projects."
WHU-China,Human Practice,1.Candlelight navigation—— communicate with professor like a friend,"The motivation of our project came from a conversation between a professor and some of our team members.
In Wuhan University, “Candlelight navigation” is an opportunity for students to directly communicate with professors and get instruction ranging from life to academy. By this chance, we had an unforgettable conversation with Professor Xin Lu who majored in bird ecology. He stressed the importance of environmental protection for many times:” The water of the East Lake used to be so clear that there were always many teachers and students swimming in it… However, because of the deterioration of the ecological environment and excessive sewage discharge, the East Lake was once covered with a layer of horrible green film. 
From then on, we have no longer seen anyone swimming in the lake…”"
WHU-China,Human Practice,2. Breakthrough——collaborate with IHB CAS,"After we discussed our thoughts with the professor Mao in the collage of Resources and Environment, he gave us some advice: If you want your ideas to become reality, you must consider the survival of the bacteria when they are exposed to contaminated water. We have not done so much thinking about the resistance of bacteria before.Then, we have consulted a lot of academic literature, and we found that it takes plenty of energy for bacteria to recycle phosphorus since this process involves Poly P dynamics. We also found that some environmental factors such as nitrogen content will not only affect the growth of bacteria, but also the efficiency of phosphorus accumulation.We came across a big problem therefore because we can’t solve these problems by just adding a few pathways. Finally we went to the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for help, R. Xuezhi Zhang introduced us a very advanced methods to treat the sewage—the symbiotic system of bacteria and algae! He also introduced us a symbiotic biofilm system, which is so helpful for our design and project improvement."

We talked about our project and he thought our design was very creative——instead of controlling the sewage discharge, active remediation of environment is more direct. In addition, the idea of changing pollutant back to resource is very effective and exciting.Besides the encouragement, we also learnt that most of sewage plant would make a direct landfill of sludge which contains phosphorus absorbed from polluted water. This is not a sustainable way for both environment and resource. This makes us more determined to complete the whole design chain from the pathway to the hardware application about our project."
WHU-China,Education engagement,East Lake HP set,"We put these 4 HP activities in this HP set, from the input survey (quality test of East Lake and Questionnaire and interview) to output community lecture, a HP set is a complete logic chain."
WHU-China,Education engagement,1.1  East Lake Water Quality Test,"In order to take a deep understanding of the environmental problem of the East Lake, especially the eutrophication, which is attributed to phosphorus content, we sampled from three different positions of the East Lake, and measured the OD value after using the total phosphorus content measurement kit. After that, we compared it with prepared standard curve to measure the total phosphorus content of East Lake."
WHU-China,Education engagement,1.2 Questionnaire and interview,"In order to know people’s understanding of the eutrophication pollution of the East Lake to make our project more realistic, we did some survey activities. We designed an electronic questionnaire and distributed it in Wuhan University, Xincun Street, East Lake community and the sewage treatment plant. In the end, 85 questionnaires were collected. We processed the data and the result is as follows:"
WHU-China,Education engagement,1.3 community lecture ,"In order to introduce pollution situation of the East Lake water quality to community and spread the idea of synthetic biology, we contacted with the local community and organized “WHU-iGEM come to the community, synthetic biology science activities”.We introduced GMO, synthetic biology, and the pollution situation of the East Lake water quality to community. Meanwhile, the contents of our project was also included. Not only do we promoted synthetic biology, but also brought some science knowledge and technology to the residents, which enhanced the scientific awareness of them. Finally, this activity achieved great result."
WHU-China,Education engagement,2. Synthetic biology enters the classroom,"In April 2018, we carried out the ""Synthetic Biology Science Lecture, Microbial Plate Graffiti Competition"", and did propaganda and education work. We guided them to understand the concept of engineering bacteria. To make the learning process fun, we organized a microbial flat-grain graffiti competition by using engineered E. coli as painting material. This activity gave us the opportunity to educate children about synthetic biology and introduce iGEM."

                We received a total of 1121 questionnaires, and most of our respondents are the young and middle-aged people.After analysis , we found that everyone buys things subjectively without choosing sweeteners. However, more than half said they would mind the use of sweeteners and want their food to have sugar and low energy. D-psicose is a natural and healthy sugar, yet little is known about it by public. This sugar with a sweetness of 70%-80% of sucrose, and with low calorie as well as possible positive effect on diabetes. So, when are asked “do you want to buy if D-psicose is added to the food”, about half of them choose ""Yes"". Therefore, we believe that D-psicose is promising to be used in food and will have huge market in the future."
XJTU-China,Public Engagement,Laboratory Open Day: Bacterial Painting,"
                For our project we launched a science camp on synthetic biology. One of the most interesting activities was Bacterial Painting. We used solid-state medium as the ""paper"" to paint on, using heat-activated, IPTG-activated expression of RFP, GFP, and BFP as luminescent proteins. The school professors were invited to lecture on aseptic handling of microbes before the event began. In this way, we have shown the infinite possibilities and fun of IGEM competition and synthetic biology to the students in the lower grades.

We exchanged and discussed with Prof. Xue about the design of aptamer-based cell free detection system (ABCD System) and the design of microfluidic chip drives by centrifugal force. On the one hand, Prof. Xue fully affirmed the innovation and feasibility of this project. On the other hand, Prof. Xue though it that if we could find a more specific biomarker from one cancer like liver cancer, which would strengthen the academic persuasion of our project. We communicated with Prof. Xue about the next clinical trial plan of the detection hardware, and reached a preliminary cooperation agreement. If possible, we could take the instrument to the lab in hospital, and use the patient's blood sample to verify the performance of the instrument, such as stability and sensitivity."

During the talk, Dr. Tang appreciated it that our ideas are of social significance. What's more, Dr. Tang also told us most of those frequently-used and classical clinical detection methods, like ELISA, CLIA and so on are time-consuming, expensive and complex, compared with Fang. 
                                            As for Fang, Dr. Tang agreed with our proposals that we are going to make Fang widely used among basic medical institutions, especially in remote and poverty-stricken areas because of its convenient and practicability. But it's worth noting that today there is an authoritative method for disease-diagnose, that is pathological diagnosis. So our detection method would just serve as a kind of screening tool rather than diagnosis method, according to Tang's suggestion. We also should pay attention to the testing sensitivity of our project if it could meet national standards or even better.

So we visited Health Service Center of Datong Street to learn about the development of tumor markers detection work in primary hospitals from President Zhan. We found that primary hospitals were mostly able to carry out screening on only one kind of basic tumor markers such as alpha fetoprotein (AFP). If people want to carry out more systematic and specific tumor screening, they had to be referred to higher-level hospitals. What's more, due to the implementation effect of Chinese medical security system and Xiamen's health policy, the screening of tumor markers at the grassroots-level health center could save about 50% of the cost compared with the large hospitals, which is beneficial for people to have cancer detection on regular.

Given that starting a new business is tough, Mr. Su believed that our team would encounter five “new” threats in the initial stage, that is, new team, new cooperation partners, new capital, new technologies and new customers. Referring to his personal accumulated experience, Mr. Su further gave us some suggestions targeting on starting a new business: considering that China's current intellectual property law system was still imperfect, innovative companies, like ours, who were known for their technological advantages must emphasize the patent-protection. What's more, when our brand was still not so influential compared to those prestigious companies, we should put seeking target customers and broadening sales channels on the front burner, and carefully prevent our technology property right from being infringed. On top of that, he proposed that since our hardware product was based on the ""government + grassroots + personal"" operation mode, it was necessary to work hard in marketing, with clear targets and strategies.

ZJUT-China,Public Engagement & Education,1. What did we discuss?,"
       We discussed the current state of resistance gene contamination. We learned that at this stage, the factory mainly uses E. coli systems and yeast systems for research. Laboratories are generally resistant to three methods: alkaline cooking, high temperature inactivation, and organic reagents. The bacteria are processed. However, this does not completely eliminate the resistance gene. In addition, she is very supportive of our project, believes that our project has certain value for environmental protection, and provides valuable suggestions for our project products, we have also made improvements.
      "
ZJUT-China,Public Engagement & Education,2. What have we learned and what impact it has on our projects?,"
        Zhang Wei mentioned that if the drug resistance gene in the engineered bacteria is removed
        before the cell is discharged, it is valuable for solving the problem of resistance gene contamination, and to some extent, preventing the contamination of the resistance gene, so that it does not So easy to spread. Our project will have great prospects for use in the market; in addition, Zhang Wei has put forward suggestions for our project. If the actual application is to be carried out, the most important problem is that in terms of cost, the cost mainly comes from two aspects. Control system hardware, on the other hand, is from the cost of electricity, electricity is mainly converted into light energy and heat, so there is a need for further cooling systems. The equipment of our project requires careful consideration of the sensitivity of light and the occlusion of light.

ZJUT-China,Public Engagement & Education,Public,"
        Through online and offline surveys, we engage people in our projects. They are also involved in understanding the main goals of our project. They are also involved in gaining some knowledge of antibiotic resistance gene contamination. Public participation makes us feel that our project is very meaningful, which gives us great encouragement. During the survey, we learned about the current public perception of bacterial resistance and our projects. This is instructive for the next step of the project. The following two questions have a profound impact on our project.

ZJUT-China,Public Engagement & Education,We are supported by the Chinese Academy of Engineering！,"
        In October 2018, we had the opportunity to interview Shen Yinchu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. He was the pioneer and founder of the Chinese biopesticide industry. Since the successful listing in the 1970s, he has led the research and development of the bio-pesticide Validamycin，which preferred pesticide to prevent rice sheath blight. We introduced the purpose and direction of our project and the working principle of the molecular machine to Academician Shen. He believed that our project was very innovative and practical. He also strongly encourages young people to innovate and think about some international problems in biological field. Academician Shen said that the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in nature is very difficult to control. There is currently no effective way to deal with the horizontal transfer of resistance genes, and the exchange of resistance genes between different strains of microorganisms can lead to very serious environmental pollution problem of resistance genes. It poses a huge threat to the service life of drugs. Academician Shen also said that our project can remove the molecular carrier of horizontal transfer of resistance genes from the source to a certain extent, and it is of great significance to solve the problem of resistance gene pollution.We are very encouraged and hope to contribute our own efforts to solve the problem of resistance gene contamination.

        Brochure
      ","
        In order to promote the science of synthetic biology, promote biosafety and promote our team's projects, we decided to make a brochure on synthetic biology after discussion. To make the brochure more interesting, we wrote a coherent story of the project and produced four cartoons to vividly visualize super-resistant bacteria. On the first day of school, we sent the brochure to the freshmen. After receiving the brochure, the students were reading it carefully. Some interested students even asked us for more knowledge about synthetic biology. We hope that this brochure will stimulate students' interest in synthetic biology and participate in more activities related to synthetic biology in the future.

ZJUT-China,Public Engagement & Education,TV interview,"
        We were unexpectedly interviewed by TV stations. Zhejiang Satellite TV, the full name of the Zhejiang Radio and Television Group satellite TV channel, is the integrated satellite TV channel of Zhejiang Radio and Television Group, which was broadcasted on October 1, 1960. After listening to our project introduction and project background, they thought that bacterial resistance is an environmental pollution problem that the public ignored. They are very interested. They hope that we can introduce them in detail to attract the public. Pay attention to the issue of bacterial resistance. Then we saw our interview in Zhejiang Satellite TV. I hope that through the media, our project can arouse the public's attention to this issue.

        WeChat public account online
      ","
        WeChat is a popular social software in China for communication by mobile phone. Some middle-aged and elderly people in China don't always believe in rumors. In order to disseminate scientific and technological knowledge to them, some scientific and reasonable views have been disseminated to prevent the elderly from being misled by rumors. We created two WeChat rumors, including bacterial resistance and GM food safety; and were promoted and forwarded in a circle of friends. Finally, we have received a lot of praise and received a lot of attention. Through our promotion, middle-aged and elderly people understand the truth behind more rumors and are no longer easily misled by rumors. It is hoped that this will enable older people to understand biology more deeply, so that the elderly are no longer misled by rumors and hope to promote public attention to biology.
